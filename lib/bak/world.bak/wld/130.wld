Wandering Endlessly through the Desert Sands~
   This is the endless expanse of the desert.  Great, golden sand dunes extend
out in all direction, as far as the eye can see.  The desert is extraordinarily
hot during the day, the heat from the sand causing the very air to shimmer and
dance like a living thing.  In the evening, under the night sky, the stars
shine above in a cloudless sky like thousands of diamonds, and the air
temperature drops to near freezing.

Wandering Endlessly through the Desert Sands~
   You appear to be hopelessly lost in the endless desert wastes.  The golden
sands, the beautiful color of wheat, stretch out in every direction, and you
can find no trace of a path anywhere.  Your footsteps are soon covered by the
blowing sands, making it impossible to retrace your steps.  The wind picks up
now and again, tossing sand into your eyes, nose, and mouth and making it
difficult to either see or breathe.

Wandering Aimlessly among the Desert Dunes~
   Dunes of golden, sun-bleached sands stretch out towards the flat horizon in
all directions.  Though the desert is a harsh and unforgiving place, it also
has a savage beauty.  During the days, the sky is the deepest azure blue you
have ever seen, glorious and without a hint of clouds.  The sun burns above in
a shining, golden orb above, causing the air itself to shimmer and dance from
the heat.  The night stretches out above in velvety blackness, sparkling with
myriad stars and the moons above - crimson red, pristine silver, and an inky
blackness where no stars shine.

Hopelessly Lost among the Desert Sands~
   Dunes of golden sand stretch out towards the horizon in every direction.  
No trail throughout the area can be seen at all, the ever-shifting sands
obscuring all traces of either animal or humanoid that pass through these
unforgiving lands.  The sands blow about momentarily in a faint breeze,
exposiung the pale, sun-bleached and weathered bones of some poor creature who
met its end here - a dangerous and stern reminder for the unwary of what this
place holds for the careless and ill-prepared.

Wandering Lost through the Shifting Sands~
   This is one of the most harsh and unforgiving climes of Krynnn - the vast,
endless expanse of golden-yellow sands and dry, barren heat of the desert.  
Few plants can grow here, save for the greyish-green yuccas and spiny cacti
that cling desperately to a roothold in the shifting sands.  Periodically some
sort of creature scurries across the sands, seeking a place to find water or
shade, its tracks immediately obscured as the winds blow the sands to and fro.
There is no sense of direction to be fouond anywhere, as all the landmarks are
obscured by the harsh and brutal weather.

towards the sky's horizon and a cloudless expanse of sky, regardless of the
time of day.  Unfortunately, the heat is scotching during the daylight hours,
the sun's strength unrelenting and merciless, anbd the night is only a few
degrees above freezing.  There appears to be no source of water anywhere, and
even those few plants which grow in the area are more grey and brown than lush
green.  The sands shift to and fro in the winds, obscuring your path as you

   You pass a short, squat cactus and you could swear you've been here before.
The sands stretch out to the skies, their golden expanse covering the area like

reaches desperately towards the heavens, spines outstretched and a deep,
ruby-red blossom bursting forth in a burst of color against the otherwise
monotonous golden sands.  The sands blow about around your feet, tiny granules
stinging your eyes and skin and blowing into your nasal passage.  Gasping for

Wandering Endlessly through the Desert~
   This is the endless expanse of the desert.  Great, golden sand dunes extend
out in all direction, as far as the eye can see.  The desert is extraordinarily
hot during the day, the heat from the sand causing the very air to shimmer and
dance like a living thing.  In the evening, under the night sky, the stars
shine above in a cloudless sky like thousands of diamonds, and the air
temperature drops to near freezing.

A Clearing By the Roadside~
   The trees and underbrush recede here a bit, providing a very small clearing.
A small stream lies on the west edge of the clearing, making this an ideal spot
to set up camp if the passing traveler should choose to do so.  Despite the
apparent convience of the area, it looks to have been seldom used for this
purpose.  The quiet sounds of the wilderness fill the clearing all around.  A
thick layer of underbrush lines the west bank of the stream, preventing further
entrance into the woods without a bit of effort.  The highway lies just to the
east.

A Faint Trail Within the Forest~
   Stepping through the underbrush reveals a faint trail of sorts, winding
through the forest.  It is very thin, just wide enough for perhaps two people.
The path is littered with dead branches and other natural debris, making
footing difficult.  Trees and foliage surround the trail on either side, and
the sounds of wildlife come from all around.  Faded tracks from some kind of
animal can occasionally be seen imprinted upon the hardened dirt of the path.
The trail continues to the north, and deadends here at a wall of underbrush.

A Small Clearing in the Middle of the Forest~
   The trail widens here, revealing a small clearing in the middle of the
forest.  Though the area is clear of trees the grass grows quite high, and many
types of wildflowers and other vegetation flourishes here.  There seems to be a
faint path through the tall grasses, leading west towards what looks like a
cave entrance.  The grass has been disturbed, smashed flat in places actually,
as though someone has come through here recently.  There seems to be something
glistening on the blades of smashed grass, though one would have to take a
closer look.  A faint trail leads out of the clearing to the northeast.

grass smashed glistening~
   Upon closer inspection, there appears to be blood glistening on some of the
flattened grass.  It is somewhat fresh, perhaps only half an hour old at the
most.  Blood begins appearing in the grass with more frequency, the closer you
get towards the entrance to the cave.  At one point, it looks as though
something was dragged through the grass towards the cave.

A Cave Entrance~
   This is the entrance to what seems like a rather expansive cave.  During the
day, sunlight illuminates a small portion of the cave here.  At night, all is
lost in darkness.  The floor of the cave is a mixture of flattened dirt, as
well as bare stone.  Bits of bone can seen strewn about here and there, though
nothing constituting a full set of remains.  The air in here is stale, and
smells slightly of decay and animal droppings.  Just to the west you can see a
large crevasse in the cave floor, preventing travel in that direction.  There
is enough room to get by on the northern and southern sides of it however.  
Several sets of animal tracks can be seen in the packed dirt of the floor.

Inside the Cave~
   This section of the cave is completely dark, and the smell goes from faint
to overwhelming.  The scent of rotten meat is quite strong here, and you're
positive you've stepped in something dreadful.  Looking around in the immediate
area, small piles of bones can be seen.  Most are picked clean, but a few
retain a few shreds of rotting flesh, a contributor to the awful smell in here.
There also seems to be alot of brush in the area, sticks and twigs, pine
needles, and leaves.  Most of it seems to be animal bedding, given the look of
it.  Here and there, it seems as though something gleams from the piles of
brush, bone, and waste.  One would have to search through it to determine if it
was something of value though.  The cave entrance lies to the east, a large
crevasse in the cave floor lies to the south, and the cave extends further into
darkness to the west.

The Back of the Cave~
   You come to what seems to be the back of the cave.  Darkness envelops you,
and even with a light to see by you'd be hard pressed to make out your
surroundings very far in any one direction.  It seems to be rather spacious,
and the floor rises and falls, not staying level in any one place.  Animal
bedding is scattered all about the area, tucked into niches and set upon rises
in the flooring.  The smell here is atrocious, and it's quite obvious something
has died in here recently and started to rot.  All but the most hardy would
feel the need to gag and possibly wretch.  A massive pile of bones lies in the
center of the room, scattering about the floor haphazardly the further away
from the main pile they get.  Bones of every sort and shape, some bleach white,
others still bearing rotten shreds of flesh upon them.  Looking about, one
would get the sudden thought that they should not be here...

Under the Docks~
   The ground here is soft, wet, and sandy, it easily sticks to people's feet.
There seems to be many footprints in the sand.  To the east, the sea can be
seen, it's waves crashing onto the beach not to far away from here.  Above your
head is the broken planks that led you down here.  They're fairly high up, but
a minotaur could easily reach up and touch the docks.  Large rocks are
scattered around the beach, some that could be used as a footstool to boost
someone back up to the docks.

E
king~
   For some odd reason, there's a statue of a knight carved in obsidian sitting
atop a chess board.  There are other figures on the board as well.  The figure
is carved with painstaking accuracy and is quite lovely, both for its
workmanship as well as the detail of the figure created.  It is a tall man,
clad in armor, with a shield bearing the insignia of a five-headed dragon.  It
is placed next to a white figure, presumably the queen piece.

E
queen~
   This is the figure of a white knight, carved out of pure white marble.  Her
features are painstakingly carved, and are exquisite in detail and beauty.  
She is dressed entirely in Solamnic armor, veaily adorned with roses, and the
image of a single dragon is embossed upon her shield.  Oddly enough, she is on
the wrong side of the board, placed carefully next to the black knight piece.

   The kelp has carefully and artfully been designed into a lounging chair/bed.
Pearls, gems, and bright gold and silver coins surround the edges of the

animals, dolphins, whales, fish, turtles, and even sharks and rays, have been
placed reverently and with great care amongst the seaweed, towards the edges.
A silvery cushion sits on the kelp, forming a soft pillow, and the kelp sways
gently in the ocean current, a lulling and rhythmic motion that is quite
soothing.
