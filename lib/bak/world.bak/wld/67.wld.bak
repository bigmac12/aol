An Arched Golden Bridge, Spanning the City~
   The walkway of the bridge is about ten paces wide or so, and shimmers in the
light from the torches placed along both sides of the bridge.  Slender chains
of gold suspend the bridge in midair, and each of the planks of its floor is
also crafted of the finest gold.  The bridge leads north and south, spanning
the entire western side of the city and connecting the Northwestern and
Northeastern watchtowers.

brightly to provide light, both day and night.  The flickering firelight causes
the gold to shimmer and sparkle, as if it was alive.

chain chains~
   The slender chains are made of the finest gold.  They do not look sturdy
enough to support the weight of the entire bridge but so do without question.
Perhaps they are magically reinforced.
