The Gangway~
   A wide wooden plank with a waist high set of ropes strung along to serve as
a rail stretches out across from the docks to one of the many ships of the
Karthay Navy.  Small, raised slats are spaced along its surface at regular
intervals to help add some traction while ascending or descending its low
incline up to the side of the ship.  Damp in places and encrusted with salt, it
is obvious that is has been in the service of the ship for many years.

edge of the ship is just a few feet away and the plank rubs slowly back and
forth, not tied in and succumbing to the motion of the waves.

The Port Rails~
   Walking along the edge of the ships deck leaves everyone perilously close to
falling down into the murky water beside the docks which is filled with unknown
sea creatures and coated in a thick skin of dirty bilge water.  A low wall runs
along the length of the ship, serving both to protect those onboard and to
allow the placement of numerous pieces of equipment needed in the operation of
this large sailing vessel.

   There is a constant bustling activity along the edges of the deck as

The clean up process continues as some carefully are pulling seaweed and out of

Near the Foredeck~
   The width of the hull here begins to transition between the narrow stern of
the ship and the wide midships.  Just behind the foredeck and beside the
forecastle, a huge sail billows slackly overhead, in the process of being
hauled in to be folded and stored while in port.  The gentle rocking motion of
the ship as it bobs in the water makes walking a little difficult, but likely
not as difficult as it would be while at sea.

The Starboard Rails~
   An unimpeded view of Karthay harbour is apparent looking out over the
starboard rails and away from the city itself.  Many other vessels are slowly
sailing about, though they are dominated by fishing boats and other members of
the Karthay Navy.  The decking along this area seems to have been freshly
swabbed and it gleams in the light, still damp in places and allowing the

Coils of Rope and Sail~
   An open spot on the deck has been taken over for the storage of some of the
rigging and a huge triangular pile of sail.  As the sails are taken down they
have to be carefully folded up for storage and have been placed here near the
cargo grates in the center of the ship to be later taken down below.  A massive
coil of braided, rigging rope lays in a high coil around a thick wooded post
projecting up from the deck which serves to hold it in place during rough seas.

An Open Area of Deck~
   The hull of the ship slowly groans and creaks below your feet.  After a full
season out at sea, the joints and seams of the construction planks need to be
firmed and regrouted, a process which will keep the ship in port for the
foreseeable future.  This small area is relatively free from clutter and
equipment allowing a spot to sit and relax without being in the way of the crew
who are constantly moving about.

be secured during the process of derigging while the ship is being refitted in
port.  The odor of salt and wood pervades the air, slowly filtering out of the
saturated decks.

reaches of the mast and the main booms.  The mainsail has been folded down and
is wrapped tightly around the boom, secured for port.

these crew members find this ascent easy even in treacherous weather.  The wood
of the mast has been polished cleanly from the passing of many people and is
coated in a thin but viscous oil, put in place to help protect the wood from
absorbing water.

squawks loudly then flies away as you approach.

stations for the ship, a crew member having to stay up here all day long slowly

   A large mast, slightly smaller than the main mast projects up and flies a

small, iron handholds have been tied into place around its width to assist in
the ascension up the mast.  The bottom portion of the wood on the mast seems to
be somewhat frayed as if it has been used as a target for throwing knives or a
whip.

The Bridge Deck~
   This deck is raised high above the main deck of the ship in order to allow
the officers to oversee the operation of the vessel and to allow a better
vantage point over the high forecastle towards the front.  Activity is markedly
slow here as the officers calmly watch the bustling work of the crew down
below.  An ornate rail traverses the front of the deck from which hang several
small racks containing various items and small arms.

The Ship's Wheel Station~
   Centered directly in the middle of the bridge deck sits the wheel of the
ship.  It is a massive spoked wheel almost five feet high with long hand grips
extending out through the outer ring from each spoke.  A squared box sits
behind it and holds the mechanical pulleys that transfer the wheels turns down
to the rudder.  At present, the wheel has been locked into place by two pieces
of long, leather strapping wrapped between the spokes.

Ladder to the Bridge~
   The main deck of the ship suddenly meets up with the front of the aft
cabins.  Some 10 feet above, the bridge deck is apparent in front of a large
structure that serves for the officer's staterooms and the galley for the crew.
This wall is entirely covered in hung equipment and small coils of rope,
carefully placed with military neatness.  A ladder with thick wooden rungs is
hung off the side and allows access up and down from above.

The Purser's Office~
   Despite the purser's monetary purpose onboard, this small room is almost
completely absent of any sort of decoration of example of wealth.  This being a
military ship the purser has adhered to strict guidelines and not allowed any
overt example of money to be displayed so as not to inflame the regular,
sometimes conscripted, crew.  There is a large desk sitting in the room, but no
sign of any kind of safe.

The Mess Hall~
   Most likely the most popular set of rooms onboard the ship for the crew, the
mess hall has been maintained in a relatively clean manner despite the raucous
meals that have been partaken here on a regular basis.  The tables are scarred
and chipped from knives and forks as well being covered with numerous bang
marks from mugs.  The only source of light comes from a low chandelier which
swings slowly back and forth in the rocking of the ship, tracing a dark stain
on the ceiling from the burning candles.

The Ships Stores~
   This room, normally locked, has been left open to be aired out because of
the foul smell left over from numerous months of pickled food being held
within.  Its walls are encircled by shelves of various sizes and small
indentations in the floor designed to hold larger barrels in place.  Off to one
corner it is apparent that the cook was not the only being which found entrance
to the store room, as evidenced by a small hole likely left by a rat.

   The preparation of the food aboard the ship has been given a very high
priority and therefore has been given extra room.  The cook and his assistants
would normally be working almost twenty-four hours a day to keep the different
shifts of sailors fed, but in port they can concern themselves more with
cleaning and making sure the proper stores have been laid back in for when they
again go back out to sea.  The tables are clean and smooth and the small cast
iron stove has been open up to be scraped out.

Four small beds are placed evenly against each side of the room and each have a
small nightstand to hold books and papers.  A small Persian rug is laid out in

able to have quiet conversation at the end of the day.

   This narrow corridor cuts down through the interior of the cabins.  It is
extremely narrow and it is unlikely that any two people could pass in opposite
direction if they were in a hurry.  Although there is no formal decoration,
they are beautifully appointed with waist high wainscoting trimmed with dark
stained oak and natural cherry.  The floors creak considerably when walked upon
and are worn down enough that the joins begin to become indistinct against the
grain of the planks.

   One of the few rooms with an outside window, the navigation room sits of to
the starboard side of the ship in close proximity to both the captains quarters
and the bridge deck.  The room is lined on one side by a series of cylindrical
holes set into a special cabinet, designed to hold the numerous navigational
charts and mathematical tables needed to properly guide the ship through the
seas.  Natural light can shine in here, much better than the pale candles used
elsewhere within the interior of the ship.

ranking members of the crew.  Although some wealthy pleasure craft have the
more advanced gnomish pneumatic devices, this method has been found easiest for
the military as it is unlikely to break.  The room smells very poorly though it

   A small side room off of the captains stateroom serves as a holding area for
those items which have been removed from enemy vessels in the name of the
Karthay Navy.  There is no particular decoration that gives away the special
purpose of the room except for a large emblem signifying the navy painted
across the floor and thin beaded curtain which separates the room from the
captain's office.

stretch from the floor to the ceiling and are glazed out with thick glass in
very heavy duty frames.  There are numerous trinkets dispersed aver the room
but they have all been carefully placed about in an orderly fashion to remind
the captain of the various ports he has visited and the conquests he has
mastered.  Everything in the room has been polished to a high shine by one of
the crew and the floors and walls are immaculately clean.  Two chandeliers hang
from the ceiling, one over the center of the room and the second directly above
the captain's desk.

   It is obvious that the captain does not spend very much time in this room.
It is Spartanly furnished, containing only a small, single bed and a standing
rack to hang the several different uniforms required during the course of a
days work at sea.  A small stack of books lies off to the side, apparently
untouched since they were placed in their nook.  The one piece of apparent
decoration is a small, faded portrait of some young woman, painted decades ago
judging by its appearance.

Essentially the roof of the forecastle, this deck is used to help tend the

often very active, obvious from the heavy wear on the decking and the deep
gouges along the rails.  There are empty weapons racks placed near the center
of the deck as this is one of the firing positions during battle.  Here and
there, small holes and nicks are apparent, likely the remains of fired arrows.

   This is a small area of decking at the front of the ship which allows an
unobstructed view of the water ahead.  This area is not used much for the
general use of the crew and is devoted over largely to the storage of the
various ropes and equipment.  It appears as though it has sustained a fair bit
more wear than the rest of the ship, partly from the equipment but largely from
the fact that it is often submerged when it hits the waves during high seas.  
The odor of salt and brine is strong and the decking is slippery and green.

   The two sides of the ship meet together in the prow, the frontmost portion
of the main body of the vessel.  Just ahead is a large spar sticking out
encircled by a line of narrow ropes and below is the figurehead of the ship.  
The figurehead is in the form of a large woman holding a trident and casting
out a stern gaze up at the sky.  The figure represent Zeboim, the patron deity
of the Karthay navy and her presence in iconography hopes to obtain good
weather and her favour during the voyage.

as it is necessary to walk one foot in front of another.  The water of the
harbour spreads out below you underneath and its gentle ripples belie the
heaving of the ship.  Obviously a popular perch for sea going birds, it is
covered in feathers and droppings, not yet cleaned by the crew.

   A set of ladders reaches up a low height to gain access to the foredeck of

ladder has been constructed twice normal width to accommodate the flow of
traffic going both up and down.  The rungs are heavy and abraded, commonly used
by sailors moving over them carrying heavy ropes or sails to be moved to other
areas of the ship.  Burrs protrude out from the iron rungs, worn down from
years of use.  Beside the ladder a low door leads into the forecastle and the
crews cabins.

   Afforded an extra amount of comfort above the rest of the general crew, the
senior non commissioned officers are allowed a room that is vacant by
comparison.  Shared by only six crew members, there is enough room for a table
and a couple chairs in the middle of the room.  The smell within however is
harsh and acrid , caused by smoke from numerous cigars favored by the bosun.  
A small hand mirror has been nailed to the wall in order to allow the crew to
trim their beards.

The smell in this area is heavy with the sulphurous scent of expended gunpowder
and oil, lingering in the air after some recent exchanges by the numerous
cannons which extend out in two lines alongside the edges of the ship.

Center of the Gun Deck~
   A narrow rope ladder extends down through the center of the hull into the
lowest section of the ship.  A large interior deck spreads out across the ships
entire width, broken up only by numerous support columns for the decks above.

and oil, lingering in the air after some recent exchanges by the numerous

A Large Porthole~
   The gunwale at this station has been opened up to try to allow some of the
air to filter out and reduce the choking smell that pervades the gundeck.  
Halfway down the hull, this porthole allows a closer view of the harbour being
not too far above the waterline.  Stray cannonballs and some burned wadding lay
beside the cannon, forgotten so far in the clean up effort.  A series of
notches line the outer perimeter of the opening signifying the number of
successful hits attained by the crew that uses this station.

Beside the Gunwale~
   The entire side of the vessel has been devoted over to the placement of the
armaments of the ship.  Large sections of the wall have been designed to be
able to be hinged in and secured open so that cannons can be wheeled into place
and fired from the relative protection within the hull.  Although they are
closed at the moment, it is obvious from the heavy wear on their hinges and the
splintered damage around them that they have been used quite recently.

A Cannon Firing Position~
   With the ship not on active duty, the cannon has been rolled back on its
short track slightly away from its porthole.  It looks as though this area has
taken some damage and the carriage of the cannon looks stuck in its current
position.  Although there is no actual hole in the side of the hull there is a
large area that bulges in and projects out large splintered pieces of wood,
possibly a glancing blow from enemy fire that spared the crews lives due to its
indirect impact.

Into the Bilge~
   The base of a ladder that leads up out of the hull stops here and is secured
firmly to the bottom.  This is the lowest area on the ship and is filled all
around with thousands of heavy stones that serve as ballast.  In areas where
the stones are lower, briny water sloshes back and forth needing to be pumped
out.  The rats do not bother to try to hide down here and they scurry about
making loud squeaking noises.  A short row of wooden seats are fastened near
the ladder, indicating that some of the crew have the unenviable job of working
down here.

The Base of the Mast~
   A massive, wide cylinder of wood that is the base of one of the masts
projects down through the ceiling.  It fits into a large metal base that firmly
ties the giant structure into the keel of the ship.  The wood is still in
excellent shape though it appears as though the damp conditions have had some
effect and have begun to strip away the outermost layers despite a very thick
coating of a foul smelling black tar which was supposed to give some
protection.

Storage Racks~
   There are racks lined from floor to ceiling along the curved walls of the
interior of the hull.  They are in numerous different sizes and all contain
heavy straps which although now hang limply would normally be used to secure
into place the cargo carried by the vessel.  The higher racks are much smaller
and have been designed to hold bales of the heavy wadding needed for the
cannons.  Below those are long shelves containing stacks of wood needed by the
repair crews to fix damage to the ship while still out at sea.

The Tiller Gear~
   At the very back of the hull there is a long series of ropes and pulleys
that stretch down from above and end at a large grouping of equipment.  This
area is designed to be the transfer point between the commands of the wheel and
the movement of the tiller and a complex set of gears connects here to the
outside of the ship.  Although the gears appear to be relatively new, they seem
to have been put under an extreme amount of stress and a number of their teeth
have broken off, likely evidence of some very poor weather encountered by the
ship and possibly the reason they are now in port for a refit.

Munitions Storage~
   A series of large racks have been cracked and broken in numerous places.  
This location is where a number of the munitions are kept, near enough to the
gundeck that they can be quickly ferried up when needed.  However, due to some
bad weather it appears as though some cannonballs, not properly secured, came
loose and smashed down on the shelves below.  One large cask filled with
gunpowder lays upturned and half spilled out, covering the floor with its
contents.  The rest of the ammunition has been removed off ship in order to
make the repairs a safer operation.

large cask~
   The large barrel is broken down its edge, allowing the black powder to
sift out and stain the floor.  Likely fallen from one of the racks, it
has yet to be cleaned up by the crew who are too anxious to start their
leave.
