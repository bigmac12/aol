An Expansive Bedchamber~
   This expansive room is the most luxuriously decorated in the entire house.
The floors of this room are made of beautiful dark-stained oak, though much of
it is covered by an expensive imported rug from Palanthas.  The walls are a
deep midnight blue in color, sparsely decorated with a few fine-looking
paintings and other items.  The ceiling of the room rises nearly fifteen feet
up, and has been magically enchanted to appear as the night skies with the
shimmering constellations in full view.  The only light in the room comes from
the soft glow of the fireplace in the south wall, as well as a few white-tallow
candles placed sparingly about, lending the room a relaxed and possibly
romantic air.  A small desk and bookcase rests against the north wall, and a
full-length mirror rests against the east wall.  A wrought-iron nightstand sits
on either side of the canopy bed, and a beautiful oak chest lies at its foot.
You notice a strange, but rather pleasant spiced scent in the air.

ceiling constellations night skies~
   &WWhen you look upward, you see that the ceiling rises nearly fifteen feet
up before dissolving into what appears to be the night sky.  All of the
constellations are clearly visible, twinkling above like gems.  The planet
Shinare seems to glow the brightest amongst the scattered stars and planets.

E
chest~
   &WThis large dark-stained oak chest is carved with patterns of flowering
ivy, and lies at the foot of the canopy bed.  It sits level with the edge of
the bed, and looks as though it could hold quite a bit.  Opening it reveals
that it is used to store clothing and other personal effects.  A strange, spicy
scent emits from the chest when opened, likely from some type of cologne or
perfume.  &n

   &WThis full-length mirror is framed in dark-stained oak, which has been hand
carved with patterns of climbing ivy.  It sits against the eastern wall,
directly across from the canopy bed.  &n

E
bookcase~
   This small bookcase is crafted of dark-stained oak, and is filled to
capacity.  Many of the volumes on the shelves bear such titles as, "&WThe Art
of Negotiation&n" or "&WCommerce Across Ansalon&n".    
~
E
desk~
   &WThis small desk is crafted of dark-stained oak, like much of the other
woodwork in the room.  It seems rather utilitarian though, and a bit out of
place with the splendor of the rest of the furnishings.  A few ledgers and
other scattered papers have been left on the desk, and a black quill and inkpot
sit in one corner.  &n
~
E
nightstand~
   &WThese two nightstands are crafted in the same manner as the canopy bed
itself.  Cast in wrought-iron and antiqued in silver, the legs of the
nightstands bear small vines and leaflets which climb upwards to hold up a
glass top etched with ivy patterns.  Placed upon both are a few white tallow
candles to provide a soft glow about the bed area.  &n

A Spacious Sitting Room~
   A small closet for cloaks lies to your left in the entranceway of the home,
before descending into a spacious sitting room where the owner entertains his
guests.  The walls and ceiling are a deep midnight blue, lending the room a
dark, relaxing mood.  The room has two windows, though both are covered with
elegant-looking blue and silver drapes.  The floor is made of smooth, dark
stained oak, though the center of the floor is covered with an expensive black
carpet from Tarsis.  A comfortable looking sofa and two large chairs, all made
of leather sit around a beautifully crafted sitting table made of vallenwood.
The only light in the room is provided by several strategically placed tallow
candles, and the soft glow of the stonework fireplace in the eastern wall.  
Delicious smells waft in from the kitchen to the north occasionally, and an
excessively thick oak door lies to the west.

Before the Base of a Tree (vacant)~
   In the midst of the forest is a path to a clearing with a huge Vallenwood
tree with a narrow rope ladder hanging from one of the branches.  The trunk of
the tree is several meters in diameter.  From the ground looking upwards one
cannot tell where the rope ladder leads, the branches are lush with deep green
leaves.  To the south side of the clearing is a large steaming pool,
alternating white and dark slabs of stone surround the pool.  Several squirrels
can be seen running about through the brush in the small clearing.  The narrow
rope ladder appears to be sturdy, however, the gaps are wide with pieces of
wood fitted in for steps.

   You ascend the ladder to the wooden porch of a small house, another rope
ladder leads upwards and a simple door leads north.  There are two simple
windows with shutters equally spaced.  He porch itself is plain, without
ornamentation of any kind.  Lanterns of faerie fire hang on either side of the
doorway giving soft light to the porch during the night.

   Lanterns with faerie fire and windows, on each wall keep the small room well
lit, various books about magic, amulets, potions, wands, pillows and cushions
are scattered throughout the room.  The only piece of furniture is a tall
sturdy cabinet with runes on it sitting between two windows on the western side
of the room.  Clearly this is the bedroom of a magic user.  A thin blanket lies
in a pile in one corner waiting to be used.  On the eastern wall a small
fireplace and chimney disappearing through the ceiling catches your attention.
In the hearth a small fire elemental dances happily in its new home giving the
room a bit of warmth during chilly weather.

   The ladder leads to the roof that is at a slight angle above the room below.
There is no railing, though there are several planters of herbs growing.  From
the roof is a view above Zivilyn's Temple.  A feeling of peace and tranquility
fill the air.  There are prints on the roof where someone has clambored about
and sat down to take in the view.  A handful of blackberries lay in a pile to
one side of the roof, gathered from bushes far below in the forest.  Looking
down one branches block the view to the ground.

An Open Loft Bedroom~
   A square cut into the ceiling of this loft bedroom is paned with glass,
allowing for sunlight to enter the room, or provides a clear view of the stars
at night.  Along the walls are built several mahogany bookcases, and a small
vanity with a mirror stands along the west wall.  The hardwood flooring is
scuffed and scored in a few places, as if the owner previously used the area
for training practice.  A full suit of armor rests on a mannequin in the
southwest corner of the room, and a four-poster bed with veiled powdery blue
curtains lies along the east wall.  A silver pendant of a white bison dangles
freely from a hook on the wall near the door.

The Living Room~
   Built of stone, the walls of this sturdy structure are adorned with the
hides of various animals.  The floor is covered by tiger pelts stitched
together to form a large rug.  A fireplace is built into the north wall,
providing heat at night, as well as providing light for this room after the sun
goes down.  In the middle of the room is set a large comfortable couch with
well-padded cushions.  A window, curtained with soft pelts, has been placed in
the south wall to allow natural lighting during the day.  On the west wall is
the door leading into this structure, while in the east wall is a door leading
into another room from which the scent of fresh baked bread wafts.  In the
corner is a ladder that leads to the loft above.  Two metal rings have been set
into the hearth just in front of the fireplace.

   In one corner of this cottage is a table with a few chairs around it.  Upon
which is a bowl containing a few sweets.  Across the room of that is a
fireplace with a small fire burning within it.  Just a little ways from the
fireplace there are two comfy looking chairs and a large couch.  There are a
few paintings on the walls and many windows about the room letting in ample
light.  Besides that, the walls are rather bare, which gives the room the feel
of a simple house.

   As you first enter this large room the huge fireplace along the south wall
immediately takes your attention.  The walls are made of sturdy granite, the
floor of cedar carefully laid and fitted so as to appear like one large solid
piece.  For decoration the walls have had expensive velvet tapestries hung on
them, each of the tapestries detailing the symbol representing one of the
orders of the knighthood carefully embroidered in gold thread.  On the floor,
in front of the fireplace, is the large pelt of an exotic beast, the fur silver
and soft as silk.  A large couch sits in the middle of the room, and a bookcase
sits along the west wall.  To the north lays a door of thick oak reinforced
with steel bands, while the door leading into this domicile is to the east.

hanging on racks for drying, and a rack used for the storage of a collection of
fine wines.  A large brick oven predominates the eastern wall of this room,
from which is almost always the tantalizing aromas of delicious foods being
cooked.  The housekeeper is always found in this room scurrying about to make
sure all the meals and treats are prepared just right.  At the north wall is a
small fountain from which fresh water is continuously piped through.  A door to
the west leads to the bedroom.

The Bedroom~
   Taking up much of this room is a huge canopied bed, covered in sheets of
blue satin.  The canopy of the bed is a thin, gauze-like material surrounding
the bed.  The floor is made of a hard wood, with woven rugs between the door
and the bed so one need not step on a cold floor in the morning.  In one corner
of the room is a wooden frame, standing so that one may walk behind it and
change clothes while remaining safe from the view of others.  A small fireplace
is at the north wall to provide extra warmth during the night or cold months.
Running around, playing with slippers and other small objects left laying
around, are a pair of terrier pups, the pets of the owner of this fine house.

   The wall of a massive country estate stretches to the northwest and
southeast.  Its closed gate stands immediately to the northwest.  Two gate
houses grace either side of the iron structure.  Immediate to the west is the
entrance to the closer of the two.  Just as functional as its twin, this
particular gate house has been recently decorated with a few charming touches.

A Winding Path Before a Narrow, Twisted Tower~
   A narrow path leads from the highway to the south, and ends abruptly at the
base of a narrow, twisted tower to the north.  The tower stands out rather well
amongst the sparse foliage along the Talonis Highway.  The tower from the
outside is very strange looking.  It is shaped something like an erect
corkscrew, rising up some forty feet into the air.  There is a narrow door in
the side of the tower, which appears to be the only way in.  The sound of birds
is in the air, from way overhead.  Looking way up to the top of the tower, you
can see that it is capped by a domed cage, which would appear to be the likely
source of all the chirping and whistling.  There is a small inscription on the
door which is very difficult to read.  It somehow begs for closer scrutiny.  
There is something about this house that makes people and creatures both keep a
wide berth.

&KThe Foyer of the Tall, Twisted Tower&n~
   You now stand within the tower, on the ground floor.  Against the northern
side of the room, a staircase along the wall spirals up to the second floor.  
This room is oddly-shaped, not quite round.  The floor is covered with tiles
made of ebony, each one etched with strange, cryptic runes.  The walls are
fairly plain, twisted like the outside of the tower.  The walls bend and twist
and contour around various cupboards, storage spaces, and concealed niches.  
There is a statue in the middle of the room, but as it is also made of ebony,
and the room is lit only with oil lamps, it is difficult to see just at a
casual glance.  There is a tall, narrow door to the south.

&mThe Den of the Nightbird&n~
   Somehow you have found yourway into the bedchamber and trophy room of the
elusive and infamous assassin, known by almost all simply as "The Nightbird".
The room is, like the main floor very oddly shaped.  Stairs wind up from below
along the eastern wall, and up from here along the eastern and southern sides
of the room.  The walls are covered with shelves and racks, upon which are
stored a great many things.  Most noticeable of all is the huge rack, fitted to
the wall precisely, upon which hangs rows upon rows of masks of all shapes,
sizes, and colours.  They look to have come from all across Krynn.  There is
also a glass cabinet along the side of the stone stairway to the east, in which
sit a few interesting items.  There is an alcove to the northwest, which
contains a single mesh cot, quite large so as to accomodate one large man, or
two people who sleep extremely cozily.  The floorboards creak slightly with
each step.

ribbons tied around differently-coloured hairs.  There are a few rare and
beautiful treasures, including a set of bracelets, a shimmering spectral ring,
and a golden crown.  Despite the majesty of these trinkets, your attention is
drawn to the two mummified hands, and the thirteen finger-bones arranged in a
semi-circle around a well-preserved human head.  The head has long black hair
and glass eyes which are light blue in colour.  There is a scar upon the man's
chin, clearly received pre-mortum.

&BThe Aviary&n~
   The top floor of the tower is open to the sky, enclosed only by a
dome-shaped wrought-iron cage.  There are numerous trapeezes and perches
hanging from the cage, upon which sit many birds of all different colours.  
There are numerous plants placed around the aviary to allow the birds some
semblance of a natural habitat.  The birds create a symphony of noise, which
almost obscures the sound of running water from within the room.  Pulling back
a few of the plants reveals a small marble fountain which spurts cold, clear
water, piped ingeniously from the ground floor.  There is a hatch along the
southwest portion of the cage which leads downward.  You can see out of the
cage in all directions, and given the sparse foliage of the region, the view is
absolutely breathtaking.

Off to one side of the garden is a small meadow, with lushes green grass.

   Entering through the front door, you are surprised to see the house in such
a state.  From the outside, the house appeared black, forboding, and decrepit,
but the inside is like a room in a royal palace.  The floor is covered with a
luxurious red carpet stitched with gold thread in patterns that seem to
continue in all directions at once.  Every furnishing has been carefully chosen
to be of the finest quality, and to add to the overall majesty of the room.  
Paintings hang on the walls, and there are a few things sitting here or there
that have yet to find just the perfect place to sit.  There is the smell of
cooking to the north.  A beaded curtain covers the door to the west.

A Hot, Fragrant Kitchen~
   The kitchen is positively bustling with activity.  A large iron stove sits
against the southwest corner, its smoke pipe extending upward into the ceiling.
Fragrant smoke pours from the stove, hinting at some lovely concoction being
prepared within.  There is a large table in the center of the room, upon which
are arrayed all sorts of foodstuffs.  There is a door to the back which sits
slightly ajar, with cold mist escaping from the bottom.  It is an obvious
storage freezer for perishable goods.  There are several shelves lined with
spices and other ingredients.  While it appears to be like any other kitchen
you have ever seen, one thing sets this one apart.  The butler is an undead
creature: a shadow.  It floats about the kitchen in sullen misery, preparing
meals as it has done for a long time, and will continue to do for the rest of
his days, or until his misery is brought to an end.  A doorway leads out to the
south.  There is a window to the east that looks out into the forest.

window~
   You can see trees, faintly lit by hanging lanterns outside the house.  
There is very little light that shines through this window, even in the middle
of the afternoon.  The window is slightly fogged over because of the cooking
going on in here.  Clearing off a spot of condensation however allows one to
look out at all the trees he could possibly desire.  When Geeves sees you
looking out there, he clucks an unseen tongue at you and &Gscolds&W, '&CYou
probably think you're something special, just because you're allowed to think
about leaving, don't you?&W'&n  Then, the creature sighs and shakes its head.
It is strange, you have never heard about such bitterness from an undead
creature.

can be seen of the floor is covered with it.  The room is dominated by a single
black, canopied bed.  A large gilted mirror sits upon the southern wall.  To
the north sits a huge bookshelf which covers the entire wall, and is loaded
down with volumes and volumes of books covering all topics.  There are more
decorations and trohpies hanging on the walls here, which are panelled with
fine, dark softwood.  Something immediately catches your attention among all
the trohpies and collectibles on the wall to the east: it is a large dartboard,
with four ruby darts sticking in the bullseye area.  Whoever lives here is a
remarkable shot.  Or at least, he likes to give that impression.

darts dartboard wall~
   Among the various hanging trophies and paintings, this board somehow stands
out.  Its cork surface is relatively new, painted with a black and white
dartboard pattern.  The various score areas are lined with gold wire.  The only
noticeable punctures in the board's surface are in or near the bullseye.  
Sitting in the board are four ruby darts, right in the bullseye.  It is
doubtful that even some of the most talented dart-players on Krynn could match
that kind of accuracy regularly, which leads one to wonder who the cheater
is...

A Decadent Library~
   Apparently the books in the bedroom were only the tip of the iceberg, and a
sizeable iceberg it is.  This large room has no walls, as every available inch
of wall space is taken up by book shelves.  A small fire burns in the fireplace
in the southeast corner.  The bay window to the west is draped over with a red,
crushed-velvet curtain and is closed to keep out the light.  In the center of
the room is a large desk, littered with papers and pens and other trinkets, too
numerous to mention.  A kender's delight.  Looking at the northeast corner, you
notice for the first time that there are no shelves at all there, but in the
shadows it is almost too hard to see.  However, on closer inspection, there is
definitely something in there, though at this distance it is hard to tell
what...  The window to the west is open, and a small perch serves as the
current roost of your favorite carrier pidgeon.

seem to indicate a recent burnt offering.  Perhaps it is just paranoia getting

end of it you see a massive wooden door with black handles.  You feel a great
sense of awe at the tall gleaming tower looming in front of you.  Beyond the
massive door is a wide marble stairs that lead up to the grand landing, edged
with massive stone balustrades.  The stairs seem endless, in some places
branching off in different directions, some passageways, barred by huge doors
and blocked guards.  To the north you see a great hall.  And To the south the
road continues on.

it is lost in the shadows above.  Two rows of thick gleaming white columns, ten
spans high, march the length of the room.  Across the shining marble floor is a
elegant carpet of gold and rust colored diamond designs.  Over at one corner is
a blazing fireplace surrounded with chairs with beautifully carved legs.  And
at the other end of the room sits wide desk carved from a special kind of wood
engraved with the symbol of Nuitari.  Behind the desk on a marble dias sits a
magnificent chair that looks more like a throne than a chair.  A series of
torches surround the hall making the hall shine brightly.  A spiral staircase
begins here, winding its way up leading to door, a door so black it seems to
suck all the light around it, its surrounded with silver runes.  To the west
you see a huge bedroom.

volumes of books in it, on one of the rows sit six thick books engraved with a
skull, a cold chill flowing from them.  Several skeletons of different kinds of
creatures hang on the wall.  In the middle of room sits a long table, designed
for several purposes, questioning and tests among many other.  As you look up
you see a hole, looking through it, once can see the black moon Nuitari.  A
spiral case begins here, winding its way down to the magnificent hall.

plain, logged walls.  Various odd forms of training equipment line the walls
and hang from the ceiling.  Most notably, a human shaped dummy occupies the
centre of the room, and it is wrapped in very soft Tarisian silk.  One can only
assume the owner trains with this very dummy, though in what way is anyones

The grass seems greener, the sounds of animals and birds more prevalent, and
even the trees here seem larger.  The trees here lean towards the structure

number of bookcases up against the walls.  The air in this room is dry and

house are large, deep blood red flowers - crimson lilies that the house is
named after.

E
garden~
   The garden looks overgrown and menacing to those not used to its appearance.
The small cobblestones make a feeble path through the garden, deterring all but
who live there.  The breeze through the leaves creates whispers and rustles,
leaving the imagination to run as wild as the garden, as if every plant was
alive, and hungry.

A Quiet Study Room~
   Steps lead up from the door to a well lit study.  Bookcases line one of the
four walls, and two of them contain books.  The third bookcase actually
contains more knick-knacks and odd things found on adventures and travels
rather than books.  On the second wall hangs two elegant tapestries.  A small
marble etched fireplace has been built into the fourth wall, creating a bit of
warmth and light.  On the third wall hangs a massive collection of well-crafted
swords, whips, and staffs.  In front of the writing desk is a large rug, with
an artist easel on one side of the desk and a few large leather chairs on the
other.

plant plants~
   Along and above the windows are vines of black wisteria, their dark violet
blossoms and green leaves acting as curtains.  Small bleedingheart plants hang
from the ceiling, their deep red and white blooms hanging down as if they were
droplets of blood.  Pots of nightshade, delicate lavender flowers with tiny
white berries decorate most of the room.  A few night hemlock trees hide in the
corners of the room, with their roots covered by black lotus blossoms.    
~
E
window windows~
   Outside the window can be seen the garden, and the front gate that leads to
a small forested path.  From here, the garden seems to be protecting the
cottage and its occupants from the outside world.  A window ledge acts as a
bench so one may perch underneath the windows and gaze outside.

A Quiet Study Room~
   Two steps lead down into a large main room, its windows partially covered by
the vines and blossoms from outside, acting as natural curtains.  Rugs cover
the hardwood floor from wall to wall, with two leading toward two other doors.
A large stone fireplace and pantry have been built into one wall, complete with
racks and shelves for food and herbs.  The rest of the room is comfortably
furnished with a large couch, a few small tables, and chairs.  On one of the
main walls hangs a beautiful tapestry of birds flying in a meadow.  Near the
tapestry almost as beautiful, is a small waterfall which flows down into a
marble and ivory pond.  It adds to this rooms order of peace and harmony.  
Ivory lamps etched in crimson roses provide the light.  They are scattered
throughout the room.

   One bookcase contains all sorts of books and pamphlets and papers on
anything magic-related, such as books on spells and potions.  A second bookcase
contains all other types of reading material - old mail, books on adventures,
private journals, and other things.  The third bookcase showcases various items
that had been found during travels.    
~
E
plant plants~
   The plants on each side of the doorway and windows have grown to the height
of the ceiling.  Halfway between a tree and a vine, these plants need little
sunlight nor water, but prefer a warm and dry climate.  The leaves of these
plants are a deep green-black in color, with some of them almost dripping with
moisture.  Large blood-red blossoms create a light, relaxing, almost lethargic
perfume that drifts in the air nearby.    
~
E
painting~
   A large painting hangs above the fireplace, the flickering shadows and light
from the fire causing the painting to look as if it was moving.  The painting
is of an adult golden dragon and a seafoam white unicorn standing within a
grove of vallenwoods, and surrounded by many other forest animals.  The
painting looks ancient, yet vibrant as if restored to its original beauty.

A Bedroom of Crimson and Ivory~
   Steps curve upward from the door into a spacious bedroom on the second floor
above the study.  Only two ivory lamps light the room, one on each side of the
steps.  A large canopy bed, draped in crimson and ivory silk, rests in one
darkened corner of the room.  A small nook has been built into the opposite
side of the room, with a large window overlooking the wildflower garden.  Soft
music can be heard threw out the comfort of this room.  Dozens of flowering
plants give off their perfume within the shadows of the room.

   Black and violet star-like flowers drape down from above and along the sides
of the large window, creating a natural drapery.  Their scent is dark and
sweet, like sugared fruit.  Within the small nook is a window bench, its padded
cushion made of black silk.  A few tiny shelves line the nook as well,
containing miniature carvings, inkwells, quills, and parchments.    
~
E
plant plants~
   The potted plants within this room seem to thrive on the darkness, their
blossoms of black velvet almost shimmering with violet from any reflection of
light.  Tall vines and deep green leaves grow almost wildly, and give off a
light, intoxicating perfume.    
~
E
bed~
   The large bed rests in one corner of the room, and has been made with red
and black silk sheets.  A large canopy rises over the bed, draped with sheer
violet silk like a shimmering curtain.  The bed itself is made of darkened
mahogany, carved with swirls and blossoms.    
~
E
wardrobe wardrobes~
   Each wardrobe built into the wall has a mahogany door, and a few shelves
upon the outside of the wardrobe.  One wardrobe has a large moon carved into
the center, and the other has a blossoming black lotus.  A set of twelve small
mirrors have been tiled inbetween the two wardrobes to create a large sectioned
mirror.    
~
E
lamp lamps~
   The lamps are in the shape of small potted trees, with branches spreading
out along the wall.  A small candle sits on each branching end, creating
flickering light whenever lit.  They are made of bronze, from the trunk of the
tree to its small slivers of leaves and branches.  The small white berries and
flowers appear to be made from silver.    
~
E
oldpainting~
   A painting decorates the wall in between the wildly growing dusky velvet
plants.  In the darkest shadows of the room, it glimmers a black tower
enshrouded in grey mists.  Not much other detail can be seen, as if the painter
himself either didn't finish his artwork, or didn't want anyone to see what he
had created.

The Barracks of Dark Hills Keep~
   Many sturdy cots line the walls of this long room.  At the foot of each bed
is placed a small chest, used to store the soldiers personal gear.  Upon each
cot, neatly folded at the foot of the bed is a heavy woolen blanket for when
the weather gets colder.  Adjoining this room are many doors leading to some of
the higher officials quarters.

Many other books are from other areas and places about Krynn.  Hanging on the
Northern wall is a large tapestry portraying a raven in flight.  Behind the

   This grand room has a high vaulted ceiling, with numerous tapestries of blue
and black hanging from the rafters and along the walls.  Upon some of the
tapestries are the symbol of a large raven in flight.  A few tables are set out
in this hall, with numerous chairs surrounding them, this hall looks to be able
to seat nearly a hundred people if the need arose.  To the east a large
entryway opens into the kitchens and pantry.  To the south large double doors
open to the outside of Dark Hills Keep.

   This kitchen is a mass array of tables stoves, and large pots hanging from
the ceiling.  Nearly a maze to wander from one end to the other, able to set a
banquet for as many people as needed.  To the west the entryway is large, so
that massive tables can be rolled through laden with food, and delicacies for
the banquet hall.  Though not always to be as festive, a large keg stands near
the door, and a table laden with food for the soldiers and men who frequent the
keep.

A Shaded Cul-de-Sac~
   You have entered a small cul-de-sac in the woods.  The canopy of
tree-branches and ivy-vines seem to make room for the light to freely enter
this place.  The gravel of the ravine is replaced with lush green grass that
covers the clearing like a natural carpet of sorts.  The vallenwoods, pines and
other trees add a rich green and brown backdrop to this beautiful place.  If
you listen closely, even the birds themselves add to the atmosphere by
providing the soft, natural background music.  To the east, you see a structure
with waterfalls that fall on each side of the door.

waterfalls waterfall~
   The twin waterfalls are fed by two irrigation canals running from the stream
in the ravine and around the perimeter of the clearing to the rear of the
house.  Somehow, the water is able to flow up the side of the house, into a
clear reflecting pool on the roof from which the channels that create the falls
are fed.  The water is crystal clear, with a crisp, clean taste.  At the base
of each of the waterfalls is a small pool where the water is collected and run
off back into the streams.    
~
E
grass~
   The grass here seems to grow unusually thick.  Its light green color accents
the surrounding woods perfectly, giving the place a touch of snugness and
comfort.  It coats the floor of the entire area, stopping only at the tree
line.  The grass feels plush to the touch and even better between the toes of
bare feet.    
~
E
canopy~
   Unlike the canopy of the ravine, these branches and vines are not
intertwined as tightly and allow for more sunlight to enter the clearing.  The
interwoven branches and vines make for a beautiful natural pattern that would
make the most talented weaver jealous.

A Partially Sunken Home~
   The first thing you notice about this home is that it is not completely
above ground.  The top of the stairs rest at ground level, but the floor is
about four feet lower and the ceiling rises another five feet up.  This room,
the largest and cleanest of them, is where the owner entertains his company.  
There is a large, plush couch placed on the far side of the room with a small,
glass topped coffee table in front of it.  There are two more plush chairs
situated to face the sofa and table.  The most noticeable feature of this room
is not a piece of furniture, but the runes that are written around the entire
perimeter where whe ceiling meets the wall.  There is a small fireplace in the
northern wall to provide heat as needed.  Doorways leading to other rooms are
in the north and south walls.

Fireplace~
   The fireplace is small compared to the size of the room.  But there is
something odd about it.  As you look closer, you can see the scorch marks that
prove it has been used recently, but you do not see any logs or tinder nearby
that would provide fuel, nor do you see any ashes in the fireplace itself,
raising questions as to how it works.    
~
E
runes rune~
   The runes the are written along the perimeter of the room are exquisitely
made.  The height of the individual runes appears to be three to four inches,
each one flowing into the next.  They have a look of flawless beauty and accent
the room nicely.  As your gaze lingers on them, you can see them slowly
shifting from a brilliant, shining gold, to an equally impressive shining
silver and back again, perpetually stuck in this set pattern.    
~
E
couch~
   The couch is overstuffed and made from a very soft and fine dark green
velvet.  The velvet is one of the finest around and has a soft sheen that
glimmers in the light.  As you move around in the room, the color of it seems
to change to differing shades of green.  When you sit on it, you feel as though
it may swallow you whole as you sink into it.

An Ornate Study~
   Stepping down into this room, you can see that it is even more sunken that
the one before it.  This bedroom and study combination is filled with furniture
made of mahogany which adds an air of silence and stillness.  On your left is a
large, unremarkable desk made of a dark mahogany, with a chair to match, in a
passing glance, you glimpse scenes that are carved into the wood of the chair.
Behind the desk are book cases, made also of mahogany, that stop about two feet
from the ceiling, and are filled with books and scrolls.  Directly across the
room from the desk is a large bed framed in mahogany that dominates the entire
wall.  As with the previous room, this one has the same strikingly beautiful
runes at the edge of the ceiling.  On the southern wall is a window.

window windows~
   The window in the southern wall is positioned at a 45 degree angle so that
the slope meets gently with the ground outside.  The thin, clear glass rests
securely on a ribed frame made of pine.  The window opens outwardly and can be
left ajar on balmy summer days and closed in the winter or during rain.    
~
E
bed~
   This bed has a mattress that seems to overflow the bounds of the frame
designed to hold it.  The mattress is stuffed with feathers, giving it a very
deep and soft feel.  The sheets are made of a thin cotton and are cool to the
touch.  Because they are designed not to hold heat, there is a thick blanket
folded at the foot of the bed to compensate for this.  At each corner is a
tall, thick post, some of which have pegs jutting out from their surface to
provide hangers on which to place robes, packs or other belongings.    
~
E
bookcases bookcase book case cases~
   These bookcases are made from the same rich, dark mahogany as the rest of
the pieces of furniture.  Sitting packed upon the numerous shelves are books
that have been gathered through purchase, trade, or even some that appear to
have been grabbed from the road side.  Stuck in-between the books is an
occasional trinket, gathered on journeys around the world.    
~
E
chair chairs desk~
   The desk is completely unremarkable, and has no ornate carvings or
inscriptions upon it.  Resting on its surface at each corner are lamps, lit at
night to provide a soft glow that can be used to write.  The chair is expertly
crafted from the finest wood.  Carvings of small scenes cover any exposed wood
on this chair.  Ranging from a simple rose, to a pair of dragons fighting and
even a bar scene complete with dwarves.  The legs of the chair are carved into
the likeness of small trees, their branches reaching out and crawling across
the frame of the chair.

A Cozy Guest Room~
   Like the study, this room is sunken even further into the ground than the
main room.  While you take the few steps down into the room, you attention is
drawn to the uniquely beautiful woven rug that dominates the floor.  Covering
the western wall is a large bed, similar to that of the study, the difference
being that it is constructed in a white pine and not mahogany.  Next to the bed
is a small night stand with a simple lamp that provides adequate light to ready
by while in bed.  Across the room from the bed is a desk of medium size, also
of white pine.  A few tapestries with lovely designs are hung around the room,
one accenting another.  Where the wall meets the ceiling are the same runes as
the other rooms, perpetually shifting from gold to silver and back.

Tapestries~
   The tapestries you see don't appear to have a real purpose or symbolic
meaning, but rather, they were chosen because of the their designs and beauty.
One hanging over the bed is woven of brilliant greens and blues and depicts
birds flying over a meadow in a clear summer sky.  Another, hanging just to the
right of the doorway, is woven of red and silver and shows an armor clad man
atop a rearing horse with his sword pointed skyward.  The last, hung on the
north wall, is woven of white and numerous other colors is of a man standing
atop a mountain peak, clad in robes of red pointing majestically at some unseen
thing.    
~
E
rug~
   This rug is unique in that the designs on it appear to have no pattern or
structure to contain the seemingly random acts of weaving.  But you realize the
harder and longer you look, the more the patterns seem to change, nothing
definite at first, but then what slowly appears to be a man sitting under a
tree, his robes flowing over the ground and his eyes eternally stuck to the
pages of the book.

A Dark, Dimly Lit Room~
   This is a dark room, decorated austerely and sparingly.  The ground is bare
stone, covered with black sheepskin rugs, muffling your footsteps.  A few dim
torches sit in wrought-iron sconces along each of the walls, their light
flickering slightly and making shadows dance along the walls.  Dark paneled
doors lead off towards the northeast and northwest, carved with a large
crescent moon in their faces.  The symbol of the moon is the only bit of
decoration in the entire room, shimmering slightly in the faint light.

the room and covering more in shadow than light.  A large bar dominates the
west wall, made of the same dark wood as the paneling and doors.  Above the
bar, a wooden rack holds numerous glasses and mugs, and a mirror covers the
entire western wall, making the room seem larger than it is.  A few low tables
are scattered around the room, and dark pillows and cushions are strewn about
the floor for seating or lounging.  There are no chairs.

assails your senses.  A large map dominates the south wall, showing the entire

   This room is barely illuminated, the feeble light from its single torch
seeming to give life to the shadows more than to light the room.  A simple
black futon is on one corner of the room, covered with thick, dense fur skins
of soft, black merino wool.  A beautiful crescent moon is carved into the face
of the north wall, sparking with the black ochre and mica paint, and flickering
in the dim light and shadows.  Smaller etchings of the other phases of the
moon, all carved in bas relief and painted with the A few simple weapons hang

and wakizashi.  A small, black night stand holds a book, a simple crystal
decanter filled with a dark red substance, and two crystal glasses etched with
crescent patterns.  A thick, black skin rug covers the stone floor.

A Small, Peaceful Glade~
   A single, beautiful aspen springs forth from the center of this small,
peaceful glade.  The plant life that surrounds this area appears always
vibrant, always in the best of health despite whatever trends the current
season may bring.  The solitary aspen that towers over the glade appears as
though in an odd state of continuous autumn, the small, heart-shaped leaves
tinted a brilliant golden all year round.  There is an odd feeling in the air
in this glade, to those that would take the time to sense it, a certain
mingling of peace combined with a lingering sense of loss.

   This aspen must be centuries old, towering high to the sky above this small,
secluded glade.  From within the high branches of the tree appears to be some
sense of movement and, upon closer inspection, one may observe several small
chimes loosely tethered to the branches, as well as a what appears to be a
single feather from an owl.

The Chamber of Kiirnodel~
   The walls of this chamber are smooth, formed of beautiful, rose quartz that
appears too fluid to have been crafted by naught but the hand of magic, risen
from the soil and shaped, not hewn.  A large desk of polished vallenwood rests
to one side of the chamber, seated nearby is a willowy chair of matching material,
topped with a soft, red velvet cushion.  A small table of rose-veined, white
marble rests opposite the large desk, its surface lined with several various
fluids and substances, a multitude of alchemical tools neatly arranged and
organized upon its surface.  Within the very center of the chamber lies a short
dias upon which stands a delicate pedestal wrought of fine silver.  The tower
itself reaches a considerable height, open to this chamber all the way but for
the extreme uppermost reaches.

desk vallenwood~
   Crafted of exquisite vallenwood and inset with fine silver, this large desk
is immaculately well-kept and cared for.  Parchment, quills, and inks are kept
neatly and carefully arrayed and within easy reach.  A single, large tome bound
in red leather with gilded pages rests respectfully upon the corner of the
desk, a series of black, silken strands used to carefully hold places within
it's pages.

A Silver Stair in the Rose Tower~
   A slender and delicate stair of silver twines its way along the interior of
the tower, spiraling to the heights above or the depths of the chamber below.
Matching the turn of the stair are several long shelves trimmed in silver, set
flush within the very stone of the walls themselves.  Contained within these
shelves are immaculately kept texts, many of them of widely varying topics
while the majority seem to focus upon alchemy, nature, and the arcane.  
Several small windows spiral along the height of the tower, as well, both
allowing for a view of the forests without and, with the aid of several mirrors
and crystal facets, directing natural light about the tower, focusing in
particular on the small pedestal in the chamber below.

Within the Master Suite~
   A small but beautifully appointed bedchambers perches here within the
uppermost reaches of the Rose Tower.  A slender bed of elven make and styling
lies to one side of the chamber, artfully draped in various silks, while a
small, wooden desk rests before a window to the east.  Along the western wall
lies an opening to a delicate balcony that offers a breathtaking view of the
sea of mature aspens that surround the tower.  A slender shelf is inset along
the eastern wall near the desk, barred securely by doors of delicate silver
wrought in the form of clinging vines and aspen leaves.  Within this cabinet
rests a collection of immaculately kept texts, bound in green and marked with
runes of silver, bearing what appears to be the arcane mark of the magus
Avanathmalyr, formerly of Qualinost.

balcony forest aspens~
   A sweeping sea of towering aspens fall just short of the peak of this tower,
lending a breathtaking view of the surrounding area.  From standing upon the
balcony a tremendous view of the western reach is available, including an
amazing sunrise that lends its pure light to the bedchambers within.  At night,
the rich, crimson light of Lunitari appears to send shimmers throughout the
beautiful rose quartz that makes up the very walls of the tower.  While this
balcony causes the tower to be open to the elements year round, it appears
plagued by neither weather, temperature, or vermin.  Tethered loosely to the
delicate, silver railing of the balcony is the single feather of an owl.

Courtyard (vacant)~
   Walls enclose a large area before a skillfully crafted stone house.  Around
the perimeter of the wall are carefully planted shrubs, bushes and young trees.
Above the stone wall to the northwest there is a view of the mountains.  To the
right, amid a rock garden is a small waterfall that drops to a pool, surrounded
by lush green plants.  Seemingly scattered around the courtyard are numerous
wooden chairs and benches.  Directly in front of you a large arched wooden door
leads into the house.

Living Room (vacant)~
   As you enter this room, a feeling of calmness enters your body.  Its
spacious walls give plenty of room for air and free movement.  Above the black
granite fireplace rests a large mantle, with many obsidian carvings of condors
resting upon it.  A hefty size couch lies in the middle of the room, providing
comfort to any who feel tiresome.  Stretched out upon the carpet is an enormous
rug.  Its design is simular to that of a red condor, with its wings
outstrentched from one side of the couch, to the other.  Lying on top of the
rug is a small, black, oval table; with a surface made of glass.

The Master Bedroom~
   Another spacious room within this house.  A large bed, sized for a king,
lies along the northern wall of this room.  Silk sheets of red and black rest
upon it, neatly tucked and folded in.  Two black shams lie at the top of the
bed, followed by two red pillows, a black condor on each.  On the southern edge
of the bed sits a chest, useful for placeing cloaks.  To the south side of the
room, near the doorway, there is a entry way into the bathroom, inside you find
a bath, a sink, and a toilet.  To the eastside of the room, a black, wooden,
bulky dresser is posistioned, to make it easier for storing clothes.  On the
western wall of the room lies a silk, weaved picture of a red condor.

The shelves along the walls have a glossy, black finish to them.  A few
confusing contraptions stand out.  A refridgerator like box sits in the
northeastern corner of the kitchen.  There is also a lemon squeezer, by
examining this tool you realize it was obviosuly built by a gnome, for it has
many start and stop buttons; seeming to make it fail proof.

   The walls along this room are aligned with rows upon rows of books.  An
enormous desk sits in the corner, with many files and papers on it.  Another
rug resides here, one simular to the one out in the living room.  Along with
bookshelves, paintings of minotaurs, clerics of sargonnas, and condors take up
most of the walls space.  A curtain lies in the northern corner of the room,
beyond it resides a large altar, made out of hardened lava, runes implanted
upon the sides, and top of the altar.

   As you enter you feel much at home, with a large black, leather couch with
silk red trim in the middle of the room.  To the east of the couch lies a small
bar, always filled with brandy of all sorts.  On the floor, near the couch,
lies a black, bear skin rug, its mouth wide open.  Above the rug is a large
oval table, which is made of obsidian and glass.  Slightly beyond the couch and
table there is a small, obsidian fireplace.  A stock of wood lies next to it,
ready to be tosed in.  On top of the fireplace lies next to it, ready to be
tosed in.  On top of the fireplace lies a crimson mantle.  On top of the mantle
stands a few condor carvings, one made out of scorched adamantine, the other
obsidian.

   Upon walking into this room, the first thing you notice is the enormous bed.
The sheets upon this bead are a black and red silk, giving comfort to any who
lay here.  Located on the eastwall is a doorway to the bathroom, inside you
will find the essentials; a bath, toilet and a sink.  A large crimson rug of a
condor lies just below the edge of the bed.  On the wall above the bed there is
a patinting slashed with black and red paint.  With closer examination you see
many red and black condors, wings stretched out, all fitting together and one
enormous condor to rest on top.

punching bag lies in the corner, taunting you dearly.  A pair of black and red
nunchukau sit on the floor, ready to be used.  A few breaking boards and slabs
of concrete also inhabit this area.  Hanging from the ceiling is a long pullup

Inside the Main Hall~
   You stand on the inside of a massive wooden door.  A hawk has been carved
onto it, and inlaid with gold.  Up above the door is a triangle carved into the
stone and embossed in silver; the symbol of Paladine.  Paladine is the god of
justice, and is also the patron god of the Order of the Rose.  In the middle of
the hall, is a great blue crystal fountain, crafted to represent the
Triumvirate.  On one of the walls, is a tapestry depicting the Platinum Dragon.
The hallway continues west from here, its high ceiling presenting an impressive
work of architecture.

engravings of a hawk in flight.

Tapestry~
   This tapestry made of finely woven silk hangs in the hallway.  Its main
feature is an embroidered depiction of a Platinum dragon, the symbol of
Paladine.  Woven on the background and all around this dragon are pictures
showing the beauty of life that every knight must remember and never lose sight
of, for it is life that Knights must strive to protect whenever possible.  
Stitched around the tapestry in silver, are various holy runes, marking this
area as sanctified by Paladine.

The Bedroom~
   This room is just as spacious as the main hall.  The walls are crafted of
white marble, and there is a thick, dark blue carpet over the stone floor, with
the symbols representing the Solamnic Triumvirate emblazoned in gold, in the
center.  About the room on the walls, are various tapestries and paintings,
depicting various scenes; from Huma fighting the Dragon Queen, to knights of
obscure identity, fighting creatures of darkness, to likenesses of the Gods of
Light; Paladine in particular.  Large, circular windows are high up on the
walls, and during early morning, and early in the evening, the sunlight falls
directly on the gold emblem in the carpet.  In one corner, you see a stairway
leading downwards, and you notice a large bed at the back wall of the room.

many shelves lining the walls are all crafted of beautifully sanded and
polished vallenwood.  The shelves themselves are stocked with a variety of
spices and ingredients from all over Ansalon.  A large iron stove is tucked
into the northwest corner of the kitchen, its smoke pipe extending upward into
the ceiling.  A larder lies through a small door to the north.  A long table
with four high-backed chairs sits in the middle of the room, places already set
for the next meal.

   The walls and floor of this room are made of black marble, veined with
silver.  A bath large enough to hold three people lies in the middle of the
room, crafted of the same black and silver marble.  A water pump stands next to
the bath, ready to fill it with warm water.  Small tables have been placed
around the room, on each table various candles are kept lit.  The candle's
flames dance with the steam that fills the room, giving it a relaxing and
exotic feel.  All of the fixtures in the room are crafted of silver, and a set
of midnight blue towels hang from one of them.  Likewise, a few small mats of
midnight blue carpet have been placed about for one to stand on while drying
off.
