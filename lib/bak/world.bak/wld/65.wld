A Small Path~
   The wind blows through the trees to the north making a rustling sound.  
Within the forest the sounds of birds and animals meet your ears.  The shadows
of the forest often seem to constantly shift and move, though perhaps this is
just a trick of the light the causes this.  The forest seems quite dense, and
could prove quite difficult to travel through..

Entering an Entangled Forest~
   No distinguishable trails seem to go through this forest.  In fact, most
every way looks different, and yet the same.  This makes it nearly impossible
for even the most experienced traveler to find his way through this forest.  
At the farthest distance a person could see, the trees seem to move, although
that may simply be the light.

An Entangled Forest~
   This forest seems to get more twisted all around, allowing no possible
exits.  All around as far as the eye can see are the same trees.  The wind
blows and whistles through the leaves, making the trunks creak and groan, or
was that moaning?  Then the sound vanishes, and all that is heard is the
rustling of leaves, and the scurry of forest animals.

An Entangled Forest~
   A loud rustling can be heard in the bushes to the west.  Then a wind comes
up rustling all of the leaves in the trees.  When the wind dies back down, the
area is once more silent.  Then from far off to the east, another rustling.  
This forest either has a very good echo, lots of creatures, or something even
worse.  It seems as though the forest is moving, as though to taunt the
traveler, to find something, or just to block way out.

An Entangled Forest~
   In the middle of this area stands a large tree.  The tree shoots above the
canopy of the rest of the trees, and allows some sunlight to filter through and
down into this clearing.  On the edges of the light, the forest continues to
shift.  On the western side of this clearing the forest makes an impenetrable
barrier, allowing no chance of escape from this end of the forest.  It seems
the forest dares travelers to try to unravel it's mysteries.

Before a Cave~
   A small cave opens to the north.  Deep within the cave a faint light comes,
just enough to see that it goes deeper under the ground, and could be much
larger.  To the west is the forest, ever shifting in the wind, even when you
can not feel one.  Then a slight wind does blow, and from the mouth of the
cavecomes a horid smell.

Inside of a Cave~
   This cave is extremely dark, the only light coming from the entry way to the
south, and far down a crumbling stairway in the back corner of the cave.  From
the depths of the stairway comes a slight breeze.  On the breeze are carried
many horrible smells, but predominate over all of them is the overpowering
smell of death.

continuing to surround all sides of the clearing.  A large flat rock lays upon
the ground making a nice resting spot for the lost traveler.

the sounds around.  The cave is practically silent, except for the constant
dripping of water, and the occasional sound of a creature of some type
scurrying through.

make out the shadow of a ladder, but all the other direction look alike.  
Small streams of water run along the floor, and down the walls, making the
footing here a bit slippery.  The walls and floor are smooth from such constant
water flow.

sound of animals scurrying about, and the dripping of water are the only sounds
that come from these caves, that and your own movements.

   The mud on the floor here has tracks as though something passed through
quite recently.  They do not appear to be the tracks of rats that have been
wandering through the caves though, but more like a boot track.  Unfortunatly,
the tracks do not lead far before they are washed out by the water and gone
once more.  The tracks though, do mean that someone or something besides rats
is down here.

tunnel, all there is to see is gray stone.  The stone floor is smooth, and
slightly slippery.  This is from the constant dripping of water, falling from
the ceiling.  Though this creates some rather large stalactites it does very
little for the rest of the scenery.

ground.  Wherever it is coming from cannot be too good or clean of a place.

An Intersection~
   The halls here are scarcely lit by a few smoldering torches.  These provide
only enough light to keep people from tripping over things, or running into
walls.  The halls are slightly chilly and kind of damp; indeed, small puddles
spot the ground every few paces.  In areas where there are worse leaks, buckets
have been placed to keep it from getting too bad.  The hallway splits into four
different directions here.  The ocassional sounds of combat come from the
south, while revelry can be heard to the west.  All other paths lie silent.

lit parts of the cave.

An Underground Labyrinth~
   The sounds of screeching and chirps is very loud here, and seems to get
louder towards the north, evidently there is a large bat colony around here
nearby.  The faint smell of bat guano is here, but not in large amounts.  The
floor of the cave here is still a bit slipppery from the water running about
the caves.  The ceiling about has just a few scattered bats around, that watch
your movements in the caverns.

   The ceiling here is a bit lower than in the rest of the caverns, and about
the ceiling hundreds of bats dart and fly about.  The ceiling is nearly covered
by bats hanging by their feet.  There is an echo of chirping and screeching,
the sounds made by the bat as they dart about, they might swoop close to
obstacles including people, but always seem to dart away at the last possible
moment.

   Somehow the rock of these caverns gives off it's own light, for it is lit,
but no torches or sunlight are visible.  Unfortunatly the light only goes so
far, and leaves many part in the tunnel in shadow.  Within the shadows, and out

A Room with a Caged Window~
   This room is fairly small, and dimly lit by torches placed in sconces on the
walls.  The only real feature of this room is a barred iron window, set into
the south wall.  Through this window can be seen a larger room, stacked with
documents and bags.  Against the back wall of the barred room lies a large iron
safe.  From the looks of things, this is most likely a bank of sorts for
individuals who frequent this community.  Apparently, even the thieves guild
can help you access funds from other banks.

A T-Intersection of the Caves~
   The tunnels of the caves meet here to form a T-Intersection.  Down any
tunnel, all there is to see is gray stone.  The stone floor is smooth, and
slightly slippery.  This is from the constant dripping of water, falling from
the ceiling.  Though this creates some rather large stalactites it does very
little for the rest of the scenery .

   The mud on the floor here has tracks as though something passed through

the tracks do not lead far before they are washed out by the water and gone
once more.  The tracks though, do mean that someone or something besides rats
is down here.

   This is dead end of the caverns, on three sides are solid rock.  Hanging
from the ceiling are massive stalactities.  Water drips from the stalactites,
forming small puddles on the floor of the cave.  The walls are really smooth
and flawless, from years of water running over them.  The sounds of small
animals scurrying around comes from farther back in the cave.

   The tunnels are very quiet, except for the constant dripping of water.  
Falling from the ceiling, and flowing down the walls, comes the water making
these tunnels very damp, and kind of chilly.  The floor is slippery and slimy
from the run of the water throughout the tunnels.  The usual smooth surface of
the walls is marred here, by some scratches on the wall.

specks of light can be seen.  Surely though this is not enough to light the

   This spacious room has been turned into a private area for patrons, designed
specifically for larger groups.  A comfortable padded bench has been built
against the length of the walls, and a large sturdy table sits in the center of
the room.  The room itself is sparsely decorated, the only noticeable addition
being a small black tapestry hanging from each wall.  Iron fittings bearing
lanterns have been set into the walls, providing adjustable light for the room.
The only exit is a doorway in the southeast wall, from which hangs a black
velvet curtain to provide some privacy.

   This is the entrance to a small community of thieves, rogues, and assassins.
The entrance itself is rather narrow, allowing only a few people to come and go
at a time.  The rogues prefer it this way; it makes it easier to protect the
community by killing off intruders by a few at a time.  On the western wall is
a network of pulleys and gears, evidently used to open the door here.  The door
itself is plainly seen from this side, it is a large cut stone, connected to
many ropes to help hoist it up.  Written on the door itself is a small message.

Gold for Goods / Goods for Gold~
   This is a pawn shop, or fencers as the term is known.  It has been titled
'Gold for Goods' by its owner, and they live up to the name.  Anybody can sell
anything here it appears, no matter how shady the item might be.  Items of
every shape and kind line the walls, in no particular order.  The counter of
the shop has been carved from the natural stone of the surrounding caverns, the
top worn smooth over time.  Placed on the counter to one side is a small weight
scale, the counterbalance having broken long ago.

A Finely Furnished Bedroom~
   This room is somewhat small, though the available space has been used well.
Expensive Tarisian rugs cover the stone floors, and tapestries depicting epic
battles hang from the walls.  The room is lit by iron lanterns hanging from
settings in the ceiling, as well as a few randomly placed candles.  Most of the
space in the room is dominated by a massive mahogany bed, covered in exotic
silk sheets.  Several other items of furniture lie about the room: an armoire,
a small padded sofa of sorts, a full length gilded mirror, and more.  Despite
the apparent finery of the surroundings, whoever frequents this room is either
a slob, or simply didn't have time to tidy up.  Clothes, mostly female, lie
scattered about the room haphazardly.  Then again, the clothes in the armoire
belong to a male...  A decorated oak door is set into the eastern wall.

   This corner of the taproom is dimly lit, indeed it would be difficult to
make out the features of anyone sitting in this corner from anywhere else in
the bar.  Whether it is dark here because of the lamps burning out, or because
it was meant to be that way is uncertain.  It is also quieter in this area of
the taproom, though not by much.  Sounds of revelry and clinking bottles and
mugs from the rest of the taproom intrude upon the solitude of this darkened
corner.

   This is the bar proper of the Thieve's Respite, tucked against the southwest
corner of the room.  Likely it has been situated in this fashion in order for
the bartender to have a full view of the taproom and its patrons, as well as
anyone new entering.  The counter is wrapped in worn, but still serviceable
leather.  A variety of bottles of every shape and size line the wall behind the
bar itself, and the delicious scent of cooking food can be smelled coming from
a service entrance at the side of the bar.

   A cool breeze blows down from the outside, only to be replaced by the stench
and smells coming from below.  The smell below smells like a fresh grave, or a
slaughter house.  A crumbling staircase leads upward from here.  This would
seem almost like a crypt, with the smell and stairs, but the evident lack of
any type of recognition to the deceased puts that thought away.

   The smell is the strongest here, and seems to be coming from a set of black
curtains hung across the eastern wall.  The wind blowing across the cave
entrance up the stairs must help to draw some of this stench out.  Without
that, the smell here would be near unbearable.  From all around come the the
sounds of moaning echoing from small chambers, and even an occasional scream.
Whether human or living dead are down here, is hard to determine.

   Morgion's curses are plainly clear here, all these denizens walk around like
living corpses.  Some would not even consider these people human, how could
they stay alive for this long, looking the way they do.  Perhaps it is hope,
however bleak and despairing.  The cleric must know this for sure, but still
she stays hoping to bring some form of happiness or of natural existance.

   This small hallway circles the center stairway, opening off on all sides to
smaller rooms.  Dreadfully ill citizens roam the hallways and the area.  They
stay for the hope that perhaps the cleric will find a remedy to some of their
ailments, but in truth slowly they are dying out of publics eye and in
ridicule.  The halls are filled with the smell of death, and the smell of
living flesh slowly decaying.

A Fetid Smelling Hallway~
   Morgion's curses are plainly clear here, all these denizens walk around like
living corpses.  Some would not even consider these people human, how could
they stay alive for this long, looking the way they do.  Perhaps it is hope,
however bleak and despairing.  The cleric must know this for sure, but still
she stays hoping to bring some form of happiness or of natural existance.

A Fetid Smelling Hallway~
   This hallway circles through ever more gruesome vissages, but here there is
a slight smell of herbs and spices, coming from the west.  That must be the
clerics working area, trying to put even a little cheer in this dismal place.
But still more living corpses walk around.  She tries all she can, but one
person can never be enough.

A Fetid Smelling Hallway~
   This small hallway circles the center stairway, opening off on all sides to
smaller rooms.  Dreadfully ill citizens roam the hallways and the area.  They
stay for the hope that perhaps the cleric will find a remedy to some of their
ailments, but in truth slowly they are dying out of publics eye and in
ridicule.  The halls are filled with the smell of death, and the smell of
living flesh slowly decaying.

A Small Clean Chamber~
   This is evidently the cleric's alcove, for it seems fairly clean, and herbs
and other strong smelling things hang from the ceiling.  Though the cleric
claims most of them are for potions and salves, most know that it is to try to
keep the smells away from the cleric enough that she can concentrate on trying
to make these poor souls lives bearable.  A spring falls from the ceiling and
down into a natural basin in the corner, keeping fresh water for the cleric, to
use.

A Small Rank Room~
   This small room reeks of death and decay.  The dwellers of these rooms, do
not try to keep their areas clean, and have pretty much given up on life.  
They come here for two reasons, one is with the slim hope that the cleric might
actually be able to heal them, two is to escape the ridicule of the cities.  
Most of them spend their time, sitting and staring as times slips by, bringing
them ever closer to Chemosh's door.

A Small Rank Room~
   This room is very untidy, and could hardly even be considered a room.  The
floor is stone, as are the walls.  A small pile of straw is by all guesses most
likely the bed.  Rats crawl about, in and out of the straw, and all around the
room.  When these people come down here it is plain to see that they are not
coming for the accomodations, but rather, to flee the uncaring and unkind
world.

A Room of Death~
   This room must be closed off for a reason.  The reason for this is what lies
in this room, those who have not lived through their illness.  The smell of
death here is strong, but it's not the smell of battle death, it's the smell of
a worse death.  A death of disease, that assails your body, and shows no mercy.
