The War Room~
   Large blocks of stone make up the walls of this room.  It reaches high
overhead, and the ceiling is not within your sight.  The floor is made of
polished black marble and echoes resound as your heels click upon it.  Weapons
of every kind and make adorn the walls, beautiful, exotic and deadly.  Many of
them have functions which are not easily deduceable.  It would take a mortal's
lifetime to learn them all, and only an immortal could hope to master them.  A
large disc hangs, suspended in the middle of this large room, serving as a
table.  Fashioned out of a single piece of pure platinum, it serves as a table
during councils for war.  This is after all, the War Room.
