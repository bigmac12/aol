Entrance to the Temple of Sargonnas~
   This large, imposing structure is dedicated to the God Sargonnas.  A large
condor arches over the doorway, its wings outspread in a macabre sort of
embrace.  A gigantic black doorway leads out of the temple, its size seeming to
make you feel small and insignificant.  The temple itself is made of inky black
obsidian, polished to a mirror-like sheen, and its walls curve in an octagonal
shape.

The Temple of Sargonnas, Outer Hallway~
   A cavernous black hallway runs diagonally through the temple, leading
through the Temple's interior.  A few twisted shapes of black metal reach out
like claws into the hallway, holding torches that barely illuminate the depths
of the dark passage.  However, rather than ridding the hallway of shadows, the
torches almost seem to draw more focus to the writhing, black, shadowy outlines
that flicker in the faint torchlight.

A Winding Corridor within the Temple of Sargonnas~
   The shadowy corridor winds its way through the Temple of Sargonnas, twisting
and turning like the depths of the heart of the god to whom it is dedicated.  
Torches in sconces provide only the merest of lights, seeming to actually give
more life to shadows than to remove them.  The walls of the corridor are as
dark as midnight, casting your reflection back at you as you stare at them.  A
narrow corridor leads east, into the Temple's interior, and the cavernous
central hallway leads around the permieter of the temple northwest and
southeast.

A Twisting Corridor that Winds through the Temple~
   The corridor of the black temple turns sharply here as it winds its way
around the temple's perimeter.  Walls of a smooth black rock surround the
corridor on all sides, and the ceiling is so far above the floor it is almost
impossible to tell where the hallway ends.  Shadows flicker and dance in the
dim torchlight, and the air hangs oppressively, as if it had a malevolent
sentinance of its own.

A Cavernous Hallway Running through the Temple~
   This black hallway winds its way through the inner realms of the Temple
dedicated to Sargonnas, Dark Vengeance.  Little light illuminates the area,
save for the faintest flickerings of a dying torch on one wall.  The hallway
continues on randomly, seeming to lead everywhere and nowhere at once, and the
shadows flicker ominously, making it difficult to be certain where in the
Temple you are.

shape of a gripping set of talons, though the torches seem to provide more
shadow than light.  Very little else can be made out in the darkness.

dagger as he passes by, spilling crimson blood into a pool on the black floor.
An odd noise echoes throughout the chamber from above, an almost inhuman howl
of agony and suffering, then all is eerily silent again.  The shadows in the
room writhe in the dim light in response, as if their sentience rejoices in the
suffering and pain.  The torches flare up brightly a moment, illuminating the
room with a sinister, blood-red light, then fade again to their dim, stark
luminescence.

solitary torch provides a meager, faint light, barely illuminating the chamber.

the most powerful and dark rituals and rites are performed in worship and
supplication to the Dark God of Vengeance.  There is a large circle of red
tracing around the room, and a gigantic altar rests in its center, symbolically
carved with red runes of power.  Looking closer at the red lines leading from
the altar into the circle and around, you notice the lines are actually narrow
channels cut into the black stone of the floor, and the red liquid running
through the channels is blood, drained from the sacrificial victims on the
altar's surface and running into wide, crimson rivulets throughout the Temple's
interior.

compared to the rest of the Temple.  Stone walls, rough and unpolished, form a
crude corridor through this level, and a stone stairway leads upwards.  Two
solid iron doors lead into cells to the northeast and southeast, and the
corridor continues southwest and northwest.

Sub-Level of the Temple~
   The basement of Sargonnas's Temple is humid and sticky, the fetid air
hanging in suffocating stillness.  Screams and moans constantly shatter the
still air, forming a ceaseless, agonized cacophony of suffering and pain.  
Iron doors lead to cells southeast and southwest of here, branching off the
main stone corridor, and a narrow stone stairway leads up to the main level.

Lowest Level of the Temple~
   The air hangs, thick and heavy and unusually still this deep into the
mountain in which Dark Vengeance's Temple is carved.  Being this deep into the
stone of the mountain, no sound can escape the layers upon layers of stone that
form the walls of this unholy place.  Shrill screams and whispered pleas for
mercy are heard from the cells extending off here, returned sometimes with
laughter and other times with more cruel, hideous sounds of bones breaking and
flesh being rendered from muscle and sinew.  A stone staircase leads upstairs,
to the main level, and two iron doors extend southwest and northwest of here.

A Windowless Cell within the Temple~
   This dark stone chamber is rank with the stench of sweat, fear, and
excrement.  The walls are carved from solid rock, left rough and jagged, and a
set of iron manacles dangle from the wall in a darkly unforgiving invitation.
A brown stain pools beneath the manacles, sticky and dried to the floor's
surface in layers upon layers of blood from innumerous victims.

A Torture Chamber within the Temple~
   Rough stone walls form the perimeters of this small, dark chamber.  A
sinister-looking device rests on the far wall, looking somewhat like an iron
sarcophagus.  Blood coats the floor beneath it, so much of it in fact that the
entire floor of the cell is covered in a layer of reddish- brown.  No window
permits light into this room, and the only exit is an iron door that is as
thick as a grown man's hand, and usually locked.

of the room, a circular wheel as tall as a human male and about four handspans
wide.  A narrow channel is carved into the floor's surface as it slopes
downwards, providing some sort of drainage from the odd- looking wheel to a
large basin that rests in one corner of the chamber.

The air reeks of numerous odors; the saline stench of sweat tinged with fear,
the unmistakable, coppery tang of blood, and the acrid smell of urine all
permeate the stale, fetid air.  Bones litter the floor, marked with deep cuts
and lacerations, some sawed completely in two, and a series of blades swing
from overhead in a silent promise or threat.

burning bodies, popping and crackling audibly as the flames consume them.  The
pyre rises far into the sky above, the smoke from the bodies thick and black,
and the unmistakable, acrid scent of burning flesh and hair nearly suffocating.
A thin powder of white, charred ashes from the many burning corpses catches the
wind and floats over the fields, coating everything below in a fine, white
powder.  Surrounding the pyre is a ring of wooden poles and spears, bodies
impaled upon them, each one bearing silent, eternal testimonial to the
ceaseless demands of Sargonnas.

heavens in a manner that almost seems to resemble a creature clawing viciosuly

towering presence looming darkly over the road's path.  There appears to be
some sort of building or structure built into the mountain's peak, and even
from this distance the stone effigy of a condor, wings outspread and beak open
in a scream, can be seen.

A Winding Black Road~
   The road narrows here as it finishes its trek through the hills and cuts its
way across the fields.  The air feels unusually still here, hanging thick and
heavy around you.  The road itself is cut from large blocks of a pure black
stone, precise squares polished to a glossy perfection.

A Winding, Obsidian Road~
   This black paved road leads between a montrously-looming mountain to the
northeast, and the main highway towards the south.  Grasses grow high on either
side of the road, and a few solitary trees try to find purchase in the rocky
soil of the moutain's base here and there.

Obsidian Highway~
   The Obsidian Highway begins here, just outside the gates of Karthay, winding
its way through the lowlands outside the city into a series of low hills which
rise up into a mountain range whose peaks are enshrouded in clouds.  Though
somewhat narrow, the road appears to be well travelled, and its surface has
been paved with black stone blocks.

Obsidian Highway~
   The road is paved with polished black obsidian blocks, cut into precise
squares and laid into a mosaic of sorts.  Precious few trees and plants cling
to the barren, rocky soil, and what few plants there are only highlight the
lifeless sense of this place.  The highway continues to the north and
southeast.  A less travelled path branches off the highway to the west.

A Roadway through the Hills~
   Redo This narrow roadway winds through the hillside leading between two of
the larger mountains.  Its dirt surface is not very well packed, and it does
not appear to be too heavily travelled.  A few barren trees stand along the
road side providing little by way of shelter or shade.

Around the Base of the Mountain~
   The road bends here as it hugs the base of one of that taller mountains that
rise high above the city of Karthay.  The roadway's narrow surface is littered
with small rocks and pebbles that have eroded off the face of the mountain.  A
few small shrubs and an occasional tree grow out from the mountain side.  The
road leads back into the hills to the southeast and further around the mountain
to the west.

A Polished Black Roadway~
   This close to the mountain's peak, the air is noticeably colder, and it
seems more difficult to breathe here.  A stone effigy of a condor is carved in
the mountain's peak, above you to the northeast.  A few details of the condor
can be made out, especially its tremendous size.  Each of the eyes of the
condor is cut from some red stone, and to be visible from this distance they
must each be the size of a full-grown human male.

A Road through the Hillside~
   The hills on this side of the mountain are much covered with much more
foliage than those on the side facing the city of Karthay.  Tall trees and some
brush line the road providing shade during the day and shelter at night.  The
road itself does not appear to be that well-travelled.  Its surface is covered
with leaves and fallen tree limbs.  The road continues its trek through the
hillside to the west and winds southeast, around the base of the mountain.

Obsidian Highway~
   Black as night, this road continues along its meandering path around the
mountain's base.  Each of the stones used to pave the road is cut to a precise
square, polished smooth from the passage of people over time.  A lone tree sits
off to the east, devoid of leaves, its dead branches reaching towards the
heavens in a manner that almost seems to resemble a creature clawing viciosuly
at the sky above.

   The highway branches off here, the black crossroads marked with a bright red
symbol in its center.  To the southwest the road continues to wind through the
hills around the base of the mountains.  The northwest path leads up into the
hills, angling steeply as it winds between two mountains.  Visible in the
distance is a bizarre carving of a condor on the mountain's summit.

   The surface of the road has been paved with the squares blocks of obsidian,
polished to a dull sheen.  The road leads towards a tall and looming mountain,
visible to the northwest.  The ground on either side of the road is barren and
rocky, with precious few plants or grass growing.  The few clumps of grass that
do cling to the rocky soil highlight the desolateness of this area.

A Black and Winding Road~
   A bright glow in the sky to the northwest can clearly be seen as a bonfire
of immense proportions, its flames licking high into the sky and a thick column
of black, oily smoke rising into the air.  The acrid stench of burningn flesh
is distinct, and a thin film of white ash filters down on you from above,
coating you in a fine layer of chalky dust.

Entrance to the Temple~
   The Temple of Sargonnas rises sharply above here, where the road ends
abruptly.  The Temple itself is actually carved from the top of this mountain,
the overall impression awe-inspiring and fearsome.  A massive black condor
arches out of the Temple, wings outstretched and raised high above, its shadow
casting over the entire area ominously.  The condor's gaping maw is open in a
timeless shriek of fury, and a black door enters the Temple through the
statue's terrible beak.

A Cavernous Chamber within the Heart of the Temple~
   This chamber is in the center of the Temple, the ceiling so high above that
its end cannot even be seen from here.  Tall, monstrous arches extend outwards
from this room, leading back towards the exterior hallway which winds around
the Temple's perimeter.  A solitary obsidian block sits in the center of the
cavernous room, holding a large chalice on its top.  Over the chalice, hanging
down from the north wall and its wings spread out ominously over the entire
room, is a black and red condor, claws extended as if to grab its prey and
crush it.
