   This pendant is made out of steel and has been formed into a thin disc.  
The center of the pendant has inlaid silver, in the shape of a triangle.  The
silver triangle is well polished, and shines in the light better than the steel
surrounding it.  On the top of the disc is a small circle, allowing it to be
hung from it's thin silver chain.

   A large pool has been carefully excavated from the native stone that
makes up the base of the city.  Its surface is as smooth as polished stone
and is perfectly flat to step upon while in the water.  A hot spring welling
up from nearby was tapped into and a constant supply of fresh, warm water
cycles through producing perfectly clear, steaming hot water.

bubbling pool jacuzzi shallow~
   The heated tub is one of the most relaxing places to sit in the public 
baths.  It has been constructed by gnomish hydrodynamic specialists and
is driven by a complex series of pipes and hoses which lead down below
to bellows which forcefully push air into the water and produce the
amazing jets and bubbles.
