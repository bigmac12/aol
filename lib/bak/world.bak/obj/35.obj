twisted staff~
   The staff is of fine craftmanship.  It is very delicately twisted but
retains the strength of a solid staff.  As it is rather short, it enhances the
control the wielder of this weapon has on it.

light.  It is trimmed with soft, silky white fur.  It is tied around the neck
with a gold chain and clips.  To most human-sized wearers, it falls to just

materials and is truly beautiful to behold.

orb small wisdom~
   A small blue sphere floats above the ground here.  Approaching it you can
get a closer glimpse, though it is nearly impossible to catch the constantly
spiralling stone.  It is smooth, shiny, and semi-transparent, purest azure blue
in color.  It glows softly, and within it you get a sense of things hidden and
obscured, exposed by the holy light which surrounds it.
