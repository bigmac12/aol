dozens of small, blunt steel studs which are closely spaced and glimmer in the
light.  It is fortunate the leather is so thick, as the garment does not cover
much of the body, save for the breasts of a female wearer.  The leather is
supple, and the inside is lined with a soft downy fur for comfort.  It is
masterfully shaped to offer all the support an active lady warrior would need.

a way that it is to be worn over one shoulder.  The material allows the body to
be covered sufficiently, but something about the fabric is very clingy, so that
it shows off every little curve and dimple of the wearer's body.  The edges of
the toga are stitched with thick purple thread, which adds some flare to an
otherwise very plain garment.
