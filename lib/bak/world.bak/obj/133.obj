leggings buckskin buckskins fringed tribal pair pile~
   These fine leggings have been tailored in a rather simple pattern from the
soft, pliable hide of the small, elusive deer of the open plains.  While rather
straightforward, this garment is durable and efficient, allowing for a brief
flair of style in their fringed seams, which serve the dual, and perhaps more
valuable, purpose of breaking up the wearer's silhouette.  Well-smoothed and
tanned, these leggings have taken on a light tan color, patterned in tribal
designs with dark, natural dyes.
