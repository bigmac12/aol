seax dwarven knife~
   The seax is a knife common only to the Dwarves.  It has a very keen edge and
a wide blade that angles sharply to a fine point.  This particular knife has a
fully adorned hilt, and beautiful scrollwork all the way down the blade.  The
seax is typically only worn ceremonially, but it is considered a lovely weapon
and is a better choice than a standard knife, due to the larger size of the
seax - at a full 13 inches.
