precise placement of lines and edges.  Once I master the form of the runes, I

dice bone pair strange black runes~
   These two dice, carved from bone, have been marked with strange runes on all
six sides.  The tradition of gambling with such dice has gone back several
hundred years, and while the rules may have changed somewhat, the runes
themselves have kept the same shapes since.    

(type 'look ROLLING' for information on how to roll the dice)
(type 'look RULES' for information on how to play the rune dice game)
(type 'look DEFENDING' for defending rune combinations)
(type 'look ATTACKING' for attacking rune combinations)
~
E
rules~
Of the six runes, there are three Low runes (Ghura, Reja, and Marixa), two
High runes (Uia and Kav), and the Ender rune (Sen).  The object of the game
is to end up with a combination of runes that beats your opponent's.  There
is a defending and attacking round, one of each for every player, and the
successful rune combinations are different depending on which round you
are rolling for.

A bet is placed before the dice are rolled.  The first roller (the loser
of the last bet) throws all three dice for the defending round.  She then
decides what combination to classify the roll under, if there is a
combination.  The player directly to the left then rolls two dice for the
attacking round, and uses the best combination he can to reduce the value
of the defending player's roll, if possible.  The defending player then
re-classifies the combination the best she can, which ends up being the
final value of her roll.  She then passes the dice to the right, and the
next player rolls their defending roll.  This continues until the last
player is finished with their turn.  Then each player's dice rolls are
compared, and the player with the highest valued roll wins the round.
If there is a tie, the two tying players play another round for the pot
while the others sit out, or, if the tie is between all players, everyone
antes the same amount as they did the past round, and another round is
played.

DEFENDING~
Defending Rune Combinations, listed in value from lowest to highest
Low runes:   Ghura, Reja, Marixa
High runes:  Uia and Kav
Ender rune:  Sen

Void - a pair of Ender runes (Sen, Sen).  If there are exactly two Ender
runes, this combination MUST be taken.
Low pair - a pair of Low runes (Reja, Reja)
High pair - a pair of High runes (Uia, Uia)
Ender - a single Ender rune (Sen)
Kingdom - a High rune and pair of Low runes (Kav, Marixa, Marixa)
Squires - a trio of Low runes (Ghura, Ghura, Ghura)
Triple Moons - Guara, Reja, and Marixa
The Father - Kav, Ghura, and Reja
Blades - a pair of High runes and a Low rune (Uia, Uia, Ghura)
The Mother - Uia, Reja, and Marixa
Nobility - all High runes (Uia, Kav, Uia)
Knights - a trio of High runes (Kav, Kav, Kav)
Final - a trio of Ender runes (Sen, Sen, Sen).  If this combination
is rolled, the player wins, and the round is over.  Any players who were
after the winning player lose their chance to play.

After the defending roll, the attacking roll can then modify the defending
roll, after which it must be re-evaluated.

attack attacking~
Attacking Rune Combinations
Low runes:   Ghura, Reja, Marixa
High runes:  Uia and Kav
Ender rune:  Sen

Void - a pair of Ender runes (Sen, Sen).  This combination forces the
defender to re-roll, if you wish them to do so, with play continuing as if
their turn just began.  HOWEVER, if the defending roll is also Void, the
defending player's roll is immediately changed to a Dual Void and he or
she wins the round.
Ender - a single Ender rune (Sen).  The defending roll remains untouched,
but for the purposes of the round, the roll becomes devalued by two steps.
For example, if the defending roll was Triple Moons, it would be considered
a Kingdom instead.
Low pair - a pair of Low runes (Ghura, Ghura).  You may change one die in
the defending roll of the same rune as the pair you rolled to a High rune
of your choice.  For example, if you rolled Reja, Reja, you could change
one Reja in the defending roll to a Kav or Uia.
High pair - a pair of High runes (Kav, Kav).  You may change one die in
the defending roll of the same rune as the pair you rolled to a Low rune
of your choice.  For example, if you rolled Uia, Uia, you could change
one Uia in the defending roll to a Ghura, Reja, or Marixa.
Lovers - Ghura and Marixa.  You may change one Low rune in the defending
roll into an Ender rune.
Pigeon - Uia and Kav.  You may change one Ender rune in the defending roll
into any other rune.

rules~
Of the six runes, there are three Low runes (Ghura, Reja, and Marixa), two
High runes (Uia and Kav), and the Ender rune (Sen).  The object of the game
is to end up with a combination of runes that beats your opponent's.  There
is a defending and attacking round, one of each for every player, and the
successful rune combinations are different depending on which round you
are rolling for.

The game begins with the first roller -- the loser of the last bet, or a
random starter -- throwing all three dice for the defending round.  She
then decides what combination to classify the roll under, if there is a
combination.  The player directly to the left then rolls two dice for the
attacking round, and uses the best combination he can to reduce the value
of the defending player's roll, if possible.  The defending player then
re-classifies the combination the best she can, which ends up being the
final value of her roll.  She then passes the dice to the right, and the
next player rolls their defending roll.  This continues until the last
player is finished with their turn.  Then each player's dice rolls are
compared, and the player with the highest valued roll wins the round.
If there is a tie, the two tying players play another round for the pot
while the others sit out, or, if the tie is between all players, everyone
antes the same amount as they did the past round, and another round is
played.

   These two dice, carved from bone, have been marked with strange runes on all
six sides.  The tradition of gambling with such dice has gone back several
hundred years, and while the rules may have changed somewhat, the runes
themselves have kept the same shapes since.

betting~
   Dice are rarely ever only played for fun, and many will become insulted by
the mere notion of not playing the game for money.  It is historically a
gambling game, and so it makes the most sense to play it as such.  There are
some fairly simple rules governing betting:

   1) At the start of the round, the first player (the loser of the last round)
declares the amount of the ante.  Those who do not wish to ante do not play
the round.  Those who do drop the amount of the ante *on the ground* next to
the dice.  If anyone is suspected of cheating but under-anteing, simply look
at the pile of coins they drop to determine if it is the correct amount.  Also
note that dice is generally a high-ante game, as there is little other betting.
If the player starting off the round does not declare an ante, then the ante
remains the same as it was in the past round (standard).
2) After the first player makes a defending roll and before the player to
the right responds with an attacking roll, the defending player has the option
to place a bet.  If he wishes to, he drops the coins he is betting and states
the amount of his wager.  If he wants to abstain from betting, then there is
NO bet and play continues as normal (eg, nobody has the option of raising his;bet of 0, because he has not made a bet).
3) If a bet was placed, the player right of the defending player who just
placed the bet has three options: she can CALL the wager, which means match it,
by placing down the same number of coins, and saying "I call," she can RAISE
the bet by first putting down the amount of the wager, then dropping the amount
she wishes to raise the wager by, and finally saying "I see your (amount) and;raise you (amount)," or she can FOLD, which means she is not allowed to play
this round and gives in her ante, but does not have to match the amount of the
wager.  This continues to the right, with a running total kept for the wager,
until everyone either decides to CALL or FOLD.  As long as someone keeps raising,
the betting round continues.
4) At the end of the round, the person with the highest dice roll after all
attacking modifiers wins the round.  If there is a tie, everyone who is tied
plays a deciding round for the pot, with no ante or betting allowed.

   Please see 'look EXAMPLE' for an example of a sample betting round.

A betting example in a round of dice
------------------------------------
   At the beginning of the round, the starting player sets the ante at 3 steel.
Everyone drops 3 steel and the game begins.
   The starting player makes his defending roll and gets Blades.  This is a 
decent roll, and he so decides to bet 2 steel.
   The player to the right thinks that he has a chance at beating that, and so
decides to call.  He drops 2 steel and says, "I call."
   The third player has not been doing so well lately, and decides to cut his
losses while it looks like he still can.  He says, "I fold," forfeiting his ante
but saving him 2 steel which he may have lost otherwise.
   The fourth and final player has been winning lately, and feels she may be
able to force others into winning her the match.  She decides to raise the wager
by 3 steel.  First she drops 2 steel, saying, "I call your 2 steel..." and then
places 3 more down, saying, "...and raise you 3 steel."
   The first player who started the betting decides that while Blades roll is
decent, it may not be enough to win with that much money on the line.  He thus
decides to fold.
   The second player now has to put down 3 steel to call, because the original
bet was 2 steel, which he payed already, and was raised 3 steel, which he has
yet to pay.  He decides to stay in, and drops three 3 steel, saying, "I call."
Had he chosen instead to raise once more, the betting would have continued until
both decide to call.
   There is no more betting for the round (that is, just after any other
defending rolls, NO betting takes place).  The fourth player ends up winning,
taking the pot.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: If player two had decided to raise by 3 platinum, this may
have caused player four to fold due to the high risk involved, or because of
insufficient funds, and player two would have won the entire pot without ever
even making a defending roll.  It is for this reason that betting limits are
often put in place -- so that no-one can out-bid anyone else.

   This pendant is a remarkable piece of craftsmanship, perfectly polished
silver that is simply breathtaking from every direction it is looked upon.  It
seems to exude a deep sorrow, however, and even touching it can cause the heart
to ache, though with a bittersweet tinge -- more like a love lost than
depression.  For some reason, the object seems deeply sentimental, and you have
a desire to keep it close to you whenever possible.

Lord Vabranion,
   My research has been completed on the work you have requested.  I thank
you greatly for your donation, and it is with great pleasure that I enclose
this pendant to present to you.
   It meets all specifications that you requested: when placed over the neck,
it will alter the user's mind patterns into believing in things that are not
there.  In addition, they will feel compelled not to remove the pendant, but
instead to carry it with them whenever possible.  The behavior exhibited by
a wearer cannot be taken for their actual actions, however, as they will
literally be transformed into a person not of sound mind for as long as they
hold it in their possession (even after they remove it).
   Finally, though I have tried, work with the...  apparition, in order to
reclaim the bracelet, I have not had much luck.  It is simply too powerful,
as its powers of this world have not yet drained.  Give me but a few more
months, however, and I am sure I will find a way to get it.

   Loyally,
   Delusen, Master of the Academy
