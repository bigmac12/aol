   This staff is more than simply a weapon, it is truly a staff meant to be
possessed and used by a mage.  It is breathtaking in its beauty, its seven-foot
shaft a glossy white in color.  In relief, seemingly carved into the surface of
the staff is silver ornamentation, winding about the staff like ivy leaves.  
The head of the staff is a latticework head, which is angular, but seemlessly
attached to the rest of the staff.  This particular staff could only be used by
a mage, and is likely enchanted to ensure that it is only used by a specific
sort of mage.
