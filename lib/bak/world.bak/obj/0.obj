they are highly sought after by fisherman for the sport of it.  It is said that
trout put up a rather fiesty fight.  Their name is a bit misleading, as they
are not rainbow colored, but are generally a steel-blue, blue-green, or
yellow-green in color depending on what type of water source they were fished
from.  The flesh of rainbow trout tends to be a vivid red in color, or light
pink if fished from a lake rather than a river or stream.  They make for a
decent meal.

to catch a decently sized one.  A trophy-worthy fish would be around twenty
pounds or so, much like this one.  When cleaned and cut into fillets, a fish
this size could probably feed five or six people.  The ideal preperation for

history family coat arms forgery~
   A heraldic device is made of a number of charges (objects, creatures, or
geometric shapes) arranged on a field (or background).  Ideally, the result is
simple, memorable, and easily identified.  The heralds restrict the possible
colors, poses, and arrangements of charges in a device.  They do not restrict
the objects or creatures you can choose from (except that you may only use
period objects or creatures).  Any good forgery, including this one, will
follow the these guidelines in order to appear completely

   This lovely family crest also comes with a complete family tree,
