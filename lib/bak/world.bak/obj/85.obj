robe robes cloak black crescent embroidered elegant ~
   These long robes are cut in an elegant and stylish fashion, providing a look
of both wealth and fashion at once.  Tailored as an outer robe, this specific
style is lending more towards a man's frame, yet may serve as a woman's with
little loss.  Cut of fine silks, they have been dyed a deep, glossy black and
almost seem to shimmer with an iridescent sheen.  Edged in a pattern of black
on black, finely embroidered runes trace their way about the garment, leaving a
large and graceful crescent moon prominent on the chest and back.

sofa couch crescent silver~
   This large sofa looks quite inviting, even despite what may at first be
somewhat ominous surrounding.  The black leather that covers its plush surface
is smooth and well-treated, soft to touch and elegant to the eye.  The arms are
tall, somewhat limiting the view both into and out of the cushions, and capped
in ornate crescents fashioned of highly polished silver.  A long, flowing robe
rests draped lightly over one arm, no small measure of care shown in its care
despite its slightly careless placement.

censer brazier brass ornate dragon multi-headed~
   This ornate piece may be used as either brazier or, in this instance,
attached to a fine golden chain and utilized as a censer.  Formed of finely
wrought brass and etched with great care, this censer bears in elegance the
crescent moon of the Dragon Queen, marking it as a vessel of Her faith.  Once
stoked and capped, the true nature of the ornate dragons head styling becomes
even more remarkable, as the fragrant smoke of incense wafts upwards from their
upturned, roaring maws.
