The tines spring out from a heavy central mass that makes it very heavy but
similarly strong.  A long strip of hide hangs down from each side across the

   The pin is clearly of superior craftmanship, wrought finely and with great
attention to detail.  Crafted from gold, the pin displays two swords crossed in
an "x" formation.  The hilts of each of the swords is laquored with a deep blue
color, and tiny emeralds are embedded into the pommel of each blade.  Even
though the pin is only the size of a man's thumb, the blades are etched with
fine, tiny runes along their length, written in a Solamnic script.
