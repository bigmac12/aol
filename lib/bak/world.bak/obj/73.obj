battak ornamented bells chimes~
   The battak serves as both a walking stick and a slapping stick, however it
also has many other varied uses.  It is shaped like a club and has a metal
wedge at its smaller end with studs at its wide end.  Several sling bullets,
which can be thrown with alot of force, may be easily stored with in its
hollowed end.  Bells, chimes and whistles have been attached to this battak in
order to make noise during a battle or to swing and make music when bored.

seal purity silver chain~
   A purity seal is often awarded by a Chaplain or other revered clergy, to
those who show themselves to be "morally pure" by their words and deeds.  
Also, before a campaign or crusade, clergymen often mark certain individuals
with litanies.  Each seal has a different blessing or invocation, intended to
implore a diety's aid or to appease it's just wrath.  Receiving a purity seal
is a highly respected honor.  This particular seal is very small, and consists
of a red wax seal holding two small strips of parchment, on which are written
litanies of faith.  A small pin on the back of the seal affixes it to a silver
chain, designed to be worn about the neck.

   This is simply a jagged rock, vaguely circular in shape.  It is about
fist-sized, and might make a good weapon in a fix.  It's alittle dusty from
lying in the road somewhere.

skirt kothian studded leather~
   This is a kilt of thick, toughened leather created by Kothian craftsmen.  
It is created in a similar fashion as studded leather armour, where steel
rivets are affixed to the leather to create a flexible surface of metal capable
of turning aside slashing attacks.  It falls from the waist to the knees,
offering excellent protection while allowing maximum manouverability.
