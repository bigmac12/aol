robe silk white~

and vestments of very plain make in an attempt to be anonymous, so that only
their deeds are remembered in the name of their god.  This simple, hooded robe
meets those needs perfectly, being made of fine white silk and bearing no
ornamentation whatsoever.

   This appears to be a plank from a ship.  The part of it that isn't buried in
the ground is about as tall as a kender, around four feet tall.  This plank
seems to be the only grave marker here, which means it was most likely someone
of high rank that once rested here.  It is surrounded in a soft, ghostly light.

it is hard to tell now.  Being buried under wet dirt for ages has made this
vest moldy and rotten.  Little remains of the once fine patterns stitched on
the chest.  The occasional slash mark appears on it, destroying most of the
bottom half of the vest.

   Once an expensive looking short sword, it is now little more than trash.  
The whole blade is covered with rust, and most the hilt is too.  The only part
that is not covered in rust is the gold plating on part of the hilt.  Small
slots in the gold have been carved out, looking like there was once gems set in
the hilt.

chair chairs over-stuffed~
   These two chairs were originally placed near the fireplace to give Gillian
and Stanley a place to rest at the end of a long day's work.  The spot was so
popular, however, that they never seem to find the time to use it.  More often
than not, they play host to a young couple looking for a quiet place to pass
some time and enjoy a drink.
