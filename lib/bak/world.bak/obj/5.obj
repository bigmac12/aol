ring red crescent moons~
   These two crescent moons, the color of Lunitari, hover on opposing sides of
each other.  Their relation never changes as they continuously spin around the
finger of the wearer.  When a spell is cast by the wearer, the moons tighten
around the finger and draw a single drop of blood, or the life essence, from
the mage.

   This well-balanced and beautifully crafted scimitar is lightweight and easy
to wield.  The blade has been crafted of mithril, one of the hardest substances
in known existence and has been polished to a high sheen.  Upon closer
examination of the blade, one can see druidic runes etched into it with gold
filling.  The hilt is wrapped in dear hide and the ball at the end of the
scimitar is a perfect, spherical emerald.  The bottom of the hilt holds a crest
with the words, 'High Ranger of the Guardian of the Wilds'.

chest vallenwood large~
   This large vallenwood chest is covered in strange, undecipherable runes,
though a few seem to resemble various animals.  It has no lock, only a small
indentation on the front, a testament to misguided trust in the honor of
Krynn's population, a seemingly easy target for rogues and thieves alike.  
Carved in green upon the lid are the words 'Guardians of the Wilds'.

   This seed is obviously from one of the great vallenwood trees, famous for
their uses as staves of the Magi of Krynn.  No amount of water or sunlight will
coax this seed to grow however, though you get the feeling its meant to fulfill
some purpose...
