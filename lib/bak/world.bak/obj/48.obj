statue white gold plate steel~
   The steel platemail armor has been made for a large, well muscled human.  
Most of the steel has been done in highly polished white, with trimmings and
designs done in pure gold - mostly of dragons intertwining around the legs and
arms of the armor.  A large shield, also white, is held to one side, with an
emblem of a gold dragon wrapped around the image of a castle.  The huge
broadsword is etched with dragons as well, with a golden scabbard.

chainmail elven suit~
   The full suit of elven chainmail has been propped up in a stance of
aloofness, taking on the appearance of a statue of an elven warrior.  The
chainmail glitters with decorative diamonds and emeralds, creating a gemstone
emblem upon the chest of a silver elm.  A beautifully engraved longbow sets to
one side of the statue, carved with symbols of tree spirits, elven spires, and
graceful flying birds.

breastplate mithril blackened scale~
   The breastplate is made of thick black leather, and covered with small
scales of polished, blackened mithril, creating an ominous appearance.  
Flowing from underneath the breastplate can be seen a robe, a deep charcoal
black color like ashes from an intense fire, the robe hiding any other armor
that might be underneath.  Along one side of the statue of armor is a large
shield, with spikes ranging in size from needles along the edges to finger's
length nearer the middle.  The shield is deep blood red, and the spikes are the
same color blackened mithril as the breastplate and robes.  To the other side
is a morning star, done in similar make as the shield - blood red and blackened
mithril.  The sheer appearance is enough to make most people uneasy.

armor red-metal dwarven gemstones~
   The suit is of dwarven make, and also the perfect size for a dwarf - compact
and well made.  The metal used is rare, even for dwarves, and appears to be
either a ruby, or some sort of glass, instead of metal.  The armor has been
polished to a clear, glass-like shine, and is decorated with gems, some
powdered, some roughly crushed, creating a pattern within the metal.  A
massive, two handed axe rests against the side of the armor, and is complete
with an obsidian handle engraved with dwarven runes, and a double blade.
