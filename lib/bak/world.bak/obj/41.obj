   This unusual weapon is invisible to the naked eye, but very, very hot to the
touch.  Only through the most scrutinous observations are you even able to
determine that it is a weapon, but once you look at it for a time, you see the
barely visible flames about it forming a short pointed sword, the preferred
weapon of assassins and thieves.  The blade is very, very hot to the touch, and
any wound that it makes almost immediately cauterizes, sealing up before any
bleeding can take place.  This is potentially the ultimate assassin's weapon.

armlets bronze decorated~
   These armlets are crafted of solid, moulded bronze.  Bronze is stronger than
iron, but as heavy as steel.  It is most commonly used in armor, weapons, and
decorative items such as statuettes and some jewelry.  It is resistant to
corrosion, but conducts electrical current and heat very well.  These armlets
were created both as decoration and as armor.  They are quite heavy for their
size, but provide an excellent amount of protection for a decorative item.  
Worn on the upper arms, they are crafted in the shape of circular bands.  Each
bears swirled patterns, as well as various birds of some sort.  When viewed in
entirety, it appears to be a motif of birds in flight, the swirling pattern
being clouds or wind.
