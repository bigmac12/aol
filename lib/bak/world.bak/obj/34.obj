veil shimmering sheer silk irridescent fabric~
   This elegant article of clothing adds greatly to the mysterious charm of its
wearer.  It is a sheer, shimmering piece of fabric very much like silk, though
silk is often difficult to find that looks quite like this.  It is clipped to
the corners and attached to a thin silver chain, whose purpose is to hold the
veil over the nose and mouth of the wearer.  The little clasps have each been
decorated with engravings of aspen leaves.

ring shaped silver dragon bright amethyst eye~
   This ring has been crafted by master jewellers from silver into the shape of
a little dragon.  This little silver dragon wraps around the wearer's finger,
its wings folded upon its back.  The detail of the dragon is astonishing, and
looking closely or with a magnifying glass, you can almost see the tiny
individual scales upon the dragon's flank and curling tail.  The dragon's
visible eye is made of a small though brightly coloured amethyst.

tapestry Silvanos~
   In this grand tapestry, Silvanos is depicted in all his regal splendor.  He
stands in the midst of a circle of towers, each tower representing one of the
Houses of his people.  Viewing this tapestry you could read the history of the
Silvanesti and know how in the ancient days Silvanos gathered together all the
tribes of elf-kind and imposed on them an order, a structure of Houses that
survives to this day.  The head of each house, the Householder, sits as a
member of the Silvanos Council, the Sinthal-Elish, and from them the kings
receive advice.

cloak fur dark blue kingfisher habbakuk~
   This cloak has been made from the pelt of some animal, and is silky smooth
to the touch.  It has been dyed a deep blue, appearing to be black in dim
light.  The fur is rather thick, making it quite useful in the winter months,
as it offers excellent protection against the cold.  It reaches down to the
ankles, and has a gold clasp at the collar, which upon closer inspection, bears
the engraving of the Kingfisher.

black velvet stitched with silver fringe.  It looks to be carved from willow,
the wood's grain polished to an almost refective shine.  Its lines are so
smooth it looks to have grown naturally to its form, having been guided in its
growth, rather then crudely shaped by a carver's tools.

long cloak reflective thread~
   Sewn from silky threads of magically imbued fibers, this cloak shifts and
alters its colours and pattern to mimic the suroundings.  It is long enough to
hang to the ankles of an elf of average height, with a deep voluminous hood
large enough to cover one's face completely.  The cloak is slightly heavier
then average cloth, causing it to hang straight and without wrinkles, moving
only minimally even in heavy wind.  A slight sense of disorientation follows
upon first wearing it as parts of your body disappear from view beneath you.

castanet carved rosewood instrument~
   This castanet is made from two pieces of beautiful rosewood.  Each piece is
carved into a concave shell and they are joined on one edge by a piece of
string.  It can be used by hooking the string over your thumb and resting the
castanet in the palm of your hand.  Use your fingers to bring the two shells
together and produce clicking sounds.    

   In practice a player generally uses two pairs of castanets: one in each
hand. They are often used by dancers to add a rhythmic percussion backdrop
to their movements.
