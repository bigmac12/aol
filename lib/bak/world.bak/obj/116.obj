Naurigu dark steel blade hellish balefire seething~
   This blade almost seems to seethe with a sense of silent rage and untold
torment.  Hellish balefire wreathes the dark blade with cold, spectral flames
that course along its length.  The blade appears centuries old, the dark
polished steel unmarred by time and etched with several undecipherable runes
that glow with an unholy black light, a color deeper than the blackest night.
The hilt is a sight of awesome dread, the cross-guard resembling outstretched
dragon wings while the hilt itself is composed of the necks of five
intertwining dragons, their heads coming together to form the pommel.  The
blade springs forth from the centerpiece of the hilt, a large black cresent,
and the eyes of the dragons are set with various precious stones, ruby,
sapphire, emerald, onyx, and moonstone.  Upon the cresent is engraved a single
word, "Naurigu," but it is uncertain whether it's the blade's name or its last
owner.

trimmers clippers hedge ichor razor~
   These hedge trimmers are immaculate in both form and function, appearing to
perhaps have been the gift of some noble to his loyal groundskeeper for years
of service.  The handle itself is formed of smooth polished vallenwood richly
stained and varnished tipped in small silver caps at the ends.  The blades are
of the finest quality steel, even appearing better than that of many a sword or
dagger.  There was once an inscription upon the blade, but years of use and
polishing have worn them down to illegibility.

bracers coiled serpents dark steel~
   These bracers are of immaculate construction and detail, the engravings upon
the serpents so precise and realistic as to make them seem alive.  Twining
about the forearms, these dark steel bracers have the appearance of being
coiled snakes, ready to strike out from the wearers hands at their will.  
Hissing mouths gape over the hands, complete with razor sharp fangs formed of
honed obsidian, and their lidless eyes of polished bloodstone sparkle with a
malevolence that is almost chilling.

fountain obsidian polished black blood~
   Formed of polished obsidian, this magnificent fountain is so reflective that
one could use it as a mirror, although the image returned is dark and slightly
distorted.  Masterfully formed to resemble the idol at the center of this
chamber, the artisian has managed to capture almost every nuance of the great
statue in minature.  A dark, viscous liquid sprays down into the collecting
basin from several of the scultpted tenticles and runs in rivulets from a
multitude of small orifaces.

   This large boulder rests here, obviously some remnant of one of the recent
landslides within the area.  It leans precariously over the edge of the shore,
tempting to plunge into the lakes unknown depths at any moment.  It's dull grey
surface has yet to develop any moss or lichens, although some signs of impact
with tree and shrub can be discerned upon it from the earlier passage from the
cliffs to its new home here.  There appears to be some odd form of writing or
symbolism contained upon it's surface near the base, but it is hard to
determine without closer examination.

   Recently slain, small stains of blood can still be descerned upon the floor
spreading out from this poor souls body.  Small, even for a kender, this body
appears to have been that of a young individual.  Brightly clad and attired,
this youth appears to have once been quite the sight, energetic and full of
zest.  Now, however, with the dull ashen tones of death upon his face it is
hard to imagine him cavorting, the sudden stillness hard to comprehend.  Still
clutched within his hand is the cut blossom from one of the many beautiful
plants about the area.

   This suit of plate mail is in immaculate condition, looking to have never
seen the battlefield.  Ornate buckles and hinges grace the joints and straps,
while several of the smaller pieces of plate themselves are tooled with
beautiful detail.  The entire suit is a deep burgundy in color, trimmed in
ebony, and joined with black leather straps tipped in golden buckles.  
Obviously designed as much for show as for practicality, it is nonetheless an
amazing suit of armor and appears to offer a great deal of defense.

   This large dwarven warhammer appears to have seen a great deal of use in its
day, although it looks none the worse for the wear.  It's massive iron head is
ornately sculpted and tooled with several, now indescernable, runes and looks
to have landed quite it's share of blows.  The once-beautiful wooden haft has a
slight reddish tinge to it and is now marred by the scores of several blades
upon its surface.  Nonetheless, it is well-balanced and still appears to have
many years of use in it.

mace ebony midnight kiss immense~
   This mace almost seems to seethe with a sense of silent rage and it radiates
a sense of palpitable power.  Its ebony head is formed of heavy, polished black
marble and etched with even darker runes that ripple with unholy light, as if
absorbing the surrounding light, creating a dark pattern that pulls at the mind
and the soul.  The haft of the weapon is formed of an alloy of iron and bronze,
quite unique as the process of blending the two metals is said to be only
possible through the addition of a odd catalyst, blood.  Along this haft is a
remarkable and chilling etching of a terrible wyrm, it's body twining about the
shaft with its tail at the base and it's roaring maw near the head of the mace.
Affixed to the base is a small, black cresent moon and dangling from the end
are several odd bones and fangs, talismans or trophies, it's impossible to
discern which.
