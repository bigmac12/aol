The workmanship of the stool is shoddy in general, and there are splinters all
over the seat that are just waiting to find a new home in some drunkard's
bottom.  You may want to consider finding a new place to sit!

canvas sack~
   This large sack is loosely woven from rough canvas.  The contents are
faintly visible through the open weave, and their musty smell wafts easily
through the air.  Small black bugs have made a home in this bag, and have made
their presence well known by devouring small portions of just about every loaf
of bread inside.

blackened metal safe~
   Dented and worn, this safe has obviously seen better days.  There is a small
gap between the door and the safe itself, but lot large enough to allow any of
the contents to spill out.  There is evidence that the security of the safe has
been in jeopardy at time, but it seems that whomever was trying to gain access
to the contents was unsuccessful.

   A thin green film coats the dented copper surface of the key, giving it an
age-worn look.  There are no markings or symbols to indicate exactly what the
key is for, but it is rather large, so one might assume that whatever it locks
might also be large as well...

lantern exquisitively detailed ornamental~
   What looks at first glance to be a gold inlay in the detailing work on this
lantern is revealed to be nothing more then a coating of iron pyrite on a
closer examination.  Looking even closer you can tell that this lantern was not
hand crafter as its seller claimed but is obviously massed produced for it has
a dwarven forge stamp in the bottom of it.  While the lantern is not exactly as
it was portrayed to be it is at least functional.

cat ears pair black leather shiny~
   This odd item looks like a pair of cat ears.  It is made out of shiny black
leather and makes the person who owns it look like a strange cat-person.  The
ears are stitched into a thin shiny leather strap that goes on your head.  The
strap has two small holes on both ends where some string has been tied it.  By
tieing the string under your neck, it stays in place, not falling off no matter
how much moving the wearer does.

part itself is not out of the ordinary.  On the front of the belt is a silver
buckle.  The tail has been stitched onto the back of the belt.  The tail curves
upwards slightly at the end.

   This large bed looks very solidly built, which is good for this
establishment.  On sides of the bed, there are carvings of various things; a
field of flowers, a dragon, a small small forest of trees, a lake with rippling
water, just to name a few.  All of the carvings were done very well and must of
taken a lot of time to do.  The bed posts raise above the bed and end in
rounded tops.  Near the middle of the posts the wood has been worn down
slightly.  Possibly where rope was tied to the bed and a person, more than
once.

leash sturdy black leather~
   This leash is very thick yet flexible.  Made from black leather, it is very
durible and won't break easily.  It looks like it was well used, the leather is
soft and easy to move.  On both ends of the leash is a large loop of leather,
one for holding, and one to be able to secure the leash to a collar.  The
thickness of the leather implys that it was either used for a very large
animal, or a person.

   This leather collar looks very uncomfortable.  It is made out of black
leather, and looks like it wouldn't break no matter how much the unfortunate
wearer tried to escape.  On the back of it is a large loop for connecting a
leash to the collar.  This loop looks large enough to handle even a very thick
leash or rope.  The collar is quite large.  Large enough for a large animal, or
maybe a human neck.

go up to the wearer's knees.  These boots are meant to be very tight, showing
off the wearer's legs.  Obviously not for combat, the heels of these boots has
been raised by a few inches, and in their place, large spikes have been placed
there, making the wearer of the boots seem taller.

too often.
