statue paladine altar dragon silver silvered tarnished rearing~
   This massive altar has long since fallen to disgrace and disrepair, yet the
care and love that was once shown to it is easy for any eye to see.  The detail
and craftsmanship alone is remarkable, if not the hand of dwarven smith then
surely the touch of the finest of man's skill.  At first startling in its
rearing pose, the expression upon the features of the dragon now appear
benevolent in majesty.  The pose inspires wisdom and compassion in its might,
clearly being a representation and honorific of the one the Solamnics term
the Great Dragon, the Father of Good.  Gilded in fine silver, the prime color of
Paladine's faithful, this testament of faith has long since dulled, now
forgotten and tarnished in form and purpose.

altar statue bison bronze bronzed proud corroded~
   This once-proud statue carries yet some token of its former glory, its
stance firm and commanding as its mighty hoof paws at the ground before it.  
Finely plated in bronze in an age passed, this massive altar is a testament to
faith and dedication, as well as the splendor of the Great Bison, the god
Kiri-Jolith, Lord of Righteous Warfare.  Wrought with great care and attention
to detail, much of that attentiveness still comes through proudly.  The fine
bronze, no doubt selected for its value and deep, rich brown color in age, has
indeed seen many an age and a far sight less attention than suitable, now
pitted and corroded in ugly, greenish blotching.

altar statue bird habbakuk marble white~
   Looming out of the dark of these forgotten chambers, this great marble
statue is of a style most impressive.  Formed by a master sculpture of
flawless, white marble, the form of a great bird has taken shape, its wings on
high, the pose both inspiring and striking.  Resplescent in form and pose, this
statue is no less than the Great Phoenix, a majestic and powerful
representation of the Fisher King, the just Lord of Nature.  While heavily
layered in dust and debris, the marble remains smooth and intact.  The only
signs of decay evident lie in the gaping socket of one, piercing eye while the
other yet glimmers with a beautiful, solitary sapphire.
