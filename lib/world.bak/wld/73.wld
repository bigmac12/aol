Merchant's Highway~
   The landscape along this highway is mostly sparse brush and trees mixed in
with the plains grasses.  The red clay mixed within the dirt, and the abundance
of rocks make this area less suited for farmland.  Wayward Highway continues
along in an eastern western direction.  The crenellated walk atop the city wall
of Istar is just visible over the tops of the trees to the south.

Wayward Highway~
   This highway travels along the countryside in an east-west fashion, passing
by sparse clumps of brush and trees that dot the landscape.  Most of the ground
is a bit rocky, and the hard packed dirt along the road is mixed with red clay,
making these plains a bit harder to use as farmland.

Crossing the Wayward Bridge~
   This bridge near Istar spans the narrowest section of the river, yet is
still quite long, and a bit too ornate for the merchants' tastes.  The sides of
the bridge are high enough to prevent even the travellers on the wagons from
accidentally plummeting into the river below.  The heavily carved planks and
bridge-fence-posts are brushed with gold dust, and is the talk of the townsmen
in Istar.  Wayward Highway continues on both sides of the bridge.

Wayward Dragonscale Crossroads~
   You come to a crossroads.  To the north lies the Dragonscale Highway while
the Wayward Highway continues to the west and southeast.  Small ruts criss-
cross the road here, indicating much wagon travel.  A small hawk floats on the
air currents overhead, always on the lookout for small rodents which are easy
to spot on the flat rocky grasslands.

   The land is flat and rocky with small patches of grass waving in the breeze.
The road here is somewhat bumpy and rocky.  Obviously the influence of Istar
only extends so far.  Undoubedly the merchants have been complaining about the
condition of this road, but nothing has been done so far to improve its
condition.  To the northeast the road bends slightly.

land streches to the horizon, generally flat and desolate.  The terrain is
curving up slightly as you see a hill far to the north.  It might be a good
place to scan the area to see what lies around you.  Peering about you see
small birds flitting about, catching the insects which seem to be in great

distance to the north lies a large hill while to the south the road continues.
A small group of black birds sqauck loudly as you approach them, rising into
the air and circling around you angrily.  There must be a nest of some sort
nearby.  With the abundance of vegetation and flowers in the immediate vicinity
there is no wonder so much animal life is nearby.

area has not been used for hunting or logging as it is pristine and unfettered

narrows in certain areas to get around rocky outcroppings which break through
the forest which still surrounds you on all sides.  As the climb gets steeper
the air takes on a bit of a chill.  Sleeping here in these hills would not be

narrows in certain areas to get around rocky outcroppings which break through
the forest which still surrounds you on all sides.  As the climb gets steeper
the air takes on a bit of a chill.  Sleeping here in these hills would not be
advisable because of this.  As well there have been tales of large wild beasts
which have been known to prey on unsuspecting travelers.

   The hills here are old, older than the forests which cover them.  Time has
weathered them so much so that they resemble the shells of giant sea turtles.
The chill breeze, ever present, and much cooler than on the plains, fills the
air with wild, yet pleasing fragrances.  The trail here is a series of slopes
and sharp turns as it winds about, avoiding obstacles, continuing in a roughly
north-south direction.

   The trail becomes smoother and flatter here.  The forest has seemed to
reclaim the landscape somewhat enveloping you in its moist freshness once
again.  Various types of song birds fly from tree to tree, fighting for unseen
food no doubt, and a few rodents peer out from the underbrush to see what new
visitors have come by this part of the highway.  The path widens a bit here,
allowing wagons to pass each other while going around the winding trail.

   The Dragonscale Highway is in much better repair here.  All ruts and wagon
trails have been cleared away by work crews, leaving a smooth gravel surface
which expedites speedy travel greatly.  Stone markers have been placed along
the road at regular intervals, however you are unable to determine their
meaning as there is nothing written on them.  The forest here has been greatly
diminished in places, leaving large bare spots of only shrubs and other
undergrowth.

   Large patches of forest have been cleared here.  The reason is unknown but
you suspect it may have been the shipwrights in Karthay taking these beautiful
trees for building the famed ships of Karthay.  Tall and majestic it is a shame

ideal for hull planks and masts.

   The smell of salt and the sea grows stronger here despite that fact you are
still well within the forest.  Through the trees to the north you think you can
see a crossroads of some sort, while to the south the Dragonscale Highway
continues into the distance.  A caravan passes close by to you, heading in a
southerly directions at a leisurely pace.  As it passes by you peer into some
of the wagons and see that they are filled with various types of dried, smoked,
or salted fish.

   This road winds it's way around the bay to the north, from which a stiff,
saltly breeze blows almost constantly.  Pebbles and slightly larger rocks have
been set here outlining the roadway's course.  Tall clumps of grass grow right
up to the line of stones here and would probably cover the entire road if it
weren't for a steady stream of traffic which keeps it at bay.

   The road meanders it's way closer and closer to the bay area here.  
Following the line of stones that mark it's course, it appears that the road
follows the outline of the bay.  The grasses have receded here somewhat
revealing more and more sand that shifts slightly as you as you walk on it.  
The breeze blowing off of the ocean has a slightly salty taste to it, making
your mouth dry.  Waves crash into the shore to the northwest as they finish
their journey across the oceans.

   Directly to the north, a little ways out in the water, a few tall thin
columns interrupt the smooth slow of the waves as they approach the shore.  
There are also several large stones just below the high tide mark on the shore
which are apparently the remains of the markers used to line the road.  
Obviously, travelers have started following a more inland trail now since the
bay has encroached onto the older road.  The breeze has increased its intensity
and begun to blow not only salt water mist your way but also stinging grains of
sand as well.

   Here half the road is below the high tide line while the other half is above
it.  There are several gaps in the row of marker stones below the high tide
line giving evidence to the sea's ability to scour the coast clean given enough
time.  Even know, small waves lap at the stones as the tide starts to come in.
The wet sand sucks at your feet as you walk leaving a faint depression when you
move on.  A wet, salty breeze blows constantly from the sea.

   The ruined remains of an old boat landing are scattered around this area.  
Several columns that apparently used to support a dock or pier of some type had
been driven into the ground here in two rows running several yards out into the
bay.  Large planks have been broken into bits and litter the ground.  The sand
sucks at your feet here making it difficult to walk.  The waves seem to slam
into the remaining columns on one side while sand piles up against them on the
other.

   Immediately to the west, several large pieces of wood are scattered about
the shore.  This section of the road seems to have been repaired slightly in
recent years to offset the damage caused by the advancing high tide line.  
Unlike the road to the south, this area has had its markers moved a ways back
from the sea to keep them from being washed away.  A strong breeze blows from
the west carrying grains of sand and a tang of salt.

out of the water.  Here, three rows of stones run along the beach marking the
old road and the new road.  Not only has the new road been moved back away from
the relentless advance of the sea, it has also been widened to accomodate a
larger volume of traffic.  The breeze from the west carries a slight tang of
salt with it.

first of several rows of small sand dunes.  Looking at these dunes you can see
the waves of water fighting with the waves of grass for supremacy.  To the

   This part of the road runs along the northern side of the bay.  Some medium
sized cliffs are climbing up out of the water here causing the road to slope
upwards slightly to the west.  Small waves crash into the cliff's base below
you and the breeze blows your hair in every direction as it constantly moves
inland from the bay.  Above you, high up in the sky, you can make out several
small shapes.  Apparently they are birds riding the updrafts caused by the
cliffs here.

   This part of the road runs along the northern side of the bay.  Some medium
sized cliffs are climbing up out of the water here causing the road to slope
upwards slightly to the west.  Small waves crash into the cliff's base below
you and the breeze blows your hair in every direction as it constantly moves
inland from the bay.  Above you, high up in the sky, you can make out several
small shapes.  Apparently they are birds riding the updrafts caused by the
cliffs here.  Stone steps, leading up, have been carved into the cliff face.

   Here, the road runs along the top of the cliffs that line the northwestern
part of the bay.  To the southwest the cliffs rise up higher while to the east
they slowly descend.  Looking out across the bay you can see line after line of
waves making their way to the shore after traveling across the oceans.  Off to
the west several small hills rest at the feet of mountains whose peaks are
hidden in clouds.

   There is a very large berry bush resting on the edge of the cliff.  It seems
to be obscuring the view of what is on the other side.

   To the north the road runs around the northern side of the bay and runs west
away from the bay to avoid the cliffs to the south which rapidly rise in
height.  Off to the west several small hills rest at the foot of a mountain
range.  Above you, high up in the sky, what appears to be a flock of birds of
some type are slowly circling.

Shores Highway~
   This part of the Shores Highway runs west inland and east towards the bay.
Off to the west and north, several small hills lay scattered about at the foot
of a mountain range whose peaks are enshrouded in clouds.  A stiff breeze blows
from the west rapidly cooling everything it touches.  Above you, high up in the
sky, what appears to be a flock of birds of some type are slowly circling as if
they are searching for something.

   This part of the Shores Highway follows a low line of hills to the west as
it travels south to the city of Karthay.  To the northeast it follows the
shoreline of the bay to the east.  Here the road is wide and relatively clear
and several marker stones have recently been laid along its sides to mark its
course which has not changed much over the years judging by the hard packed
earth under your feet.
