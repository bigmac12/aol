Outside the Gates of an Abandoned Garden~
   Large gates of black and rusted green wrought iron stand at an imposing
ten meters high.  The handles of the gates have rusted off, and the iron is
covered with intertwining vines of thorn ivy and wild roses, making it almost
impossible to see inside, or open without cutting yourself.  More thorn ivy and
wild roses grow along the stone wall, which also reaches an amazing ten
meters high.  It is, to say the least, a slight obstacle.

Inside the Entrance of an Abandoned Garden~
   Directly to the south are the impossibly high gates of rusted wrought iron.
Like the outside of the garden, this side is also covered with intertwining
vines of thorn ivy and wild roses, making it impossible to see outside, or to
open the gates.  The stone walls are not as covered by the vines, but instead
seem to have silvery green moss growing in between the stones.  The grass
growing inside this garden is also silvery green in color, and grows about two
feet high.  The stone pathway leading from the gates to the inner courtyard is
broken, and some moss and grass grows in between these stones as well.  On each
side of the pathway grows various flowers - colorful and deadly.

A Stone Pathway Through an Abandoned Garden~
   The stones that make up the outer courtyard pathway of this abandoned garden
are broken and discolored; no longer smooth and grey in color.  Silvery moss
and silver green grass grows inbetween the stones, making them slippery.  On
each side of the pathway are various, colourful flowers, bushes, and vines,
full of fragrant blooms and branches burdened with overripe fruits and nasty
thorns.  They almost seem dangerous and overbearing in their appearance.  The
pathway of the outer courtyard continues northwards, and to the south it leads
to the large, rusted iron gates - the once-used entrance to the garden.

   The stone pathway around the outer courtyard is broken and discoloured - no
longer smooth and grey.  Silver moss and silvery green grass grows in between
the stones, and along the pathway, in the midst of all the various blooming
plants, flowers, vines and bushes.  The pathway continues to the east and
north, and to the northeast is the inner courtyard.

various, blooming plants and flowers and vines.  The pathway seems safest at
the moment, for the flowers, though beautiful, look imposing and overbearing
with their markings and thorns.  The pathway continues to the south, and the
outer courtyard continues in a circle, westwards and eastwards, with the inner
courtyard to the north.

The Inner Courtyard of an Abandoned Garden~
   The branches of the weeping willow flash a silvery green in the sunlight,
and seems to create a natural drapery within the courtyard.  The large trunk of
the tree creates a naturally formed hollow bowl, from which clear water
collects, making a wounderous bird bath type fountain.  The stones seem to grow
around the roots of the willow and outwards, and everything is at peace within
the willow's reach.  The outer courtyard lies to the eastern, western and
southern directions, and to the north lies a building made of only vines,
branches and flowers - a thick wall of vegetation, and guarded by two statues
from those who would dare defile nature at its purest.

   The pathway ends here abruptly, at the base of a large chestnut tree.  The
tree seems to almost grow into the stone wall, with the roots loosening a few
of the stones at the bottom of the wall, and the branches reaching over the top
with ease.  The vines of roses and thorns continue to grow along the wall,
continuing to the north, and some even started to grow up the trunk of the
chestnut tree.  The path continues back to the southeast, toward the front of
the abandoned garden.

   The branches of this chestnut tree are thick and stable enough to hold
almost anyone.  They branch out over the wall easily, and you can see below you
a wonderous garden full of many different bushes, flowers, and small trees.  
You realize, too late, you cannot climb back down the trunk of the tree, but
you must jump from the branches into the garden.

way out other than the way you came.  The stone wall, at its imposing ten

Walking Within an Abandoned Garden~
   You are surrounded by tall ornamental grasses, overbearing bushes loaded
with ripe fruits and berries, and oddly imposing flowers of various shapes,
sizes, colors and blooms.  There is no path in this abandoned garden - any such
trail has long been overtaken by the plantlife itself.  They almost seem to
have a life of their own, here in their haven of nature.

A Room within the Crimson Moon~
   The room resembles the inside of a bubble, with no actual sides, floor or
ceiling.  The 'wall' is perfectly smooth and spherical in nature, and is a
dull, opaque red color that barely pulses with energy.  Images play upon the
walls like an illusional projector - the windows to the world of Krynn.  
Objects appear and disappear at the will of the goddess - a few chairs for
guests, an odd coloured desk, a few ice cold drinks - even a pet can suddenly
appear in the room at the whim of the goddess.
