A Faint Game Trail~
   A barely noticable game trail runs through a thick stand of juvenile
alder saplings.  All other growth has been choked out due to their density,
leaving only sparse grass and green lichens sticking to the occational small
stone.  Animals have eroded a small path between the trees leaving a twisting
brown line devoid of all vegetation.  In places, branches are broken high
enough to indicate the passing of something larger.

A Game Trail~
   A game trail continues through a thick stand of young trees.  Spiders webs
and cocoons hang from the branches, getting caught on the clothes and fur of
passers by.  A constant, hushed rustling comes from above as the branches and
leaves scrape together in the breeze.  To the side, the remains of an old
rabbit snare lay useless and in pieces, no longer of any value.

A Wider Game Trail~
   A wide trail meanders through the woods, crossing mossy, fallen trees now
the home for numerous small animals.  Scurrying moises can be heard in the
undergrowth to the sides as the forests residents shy away from the passing
of intruders.  The trees appear to be in vigorous health, and the humus covered
ground is soft and comfortable to walk upon.  A strong scent of pine and musty
leaves wafts throught the breeze.

Thickening of the Trees~
   A cluster of pine trees chokes out visibility and obscures the ground.  The
dense, green branches must be forcefully pushed aside to facilitate movement,
and they spring back into place at your passing.  A thick layer of what must be
pine needles crunch under the feet, scaring away small birds hiding within the
trees.  They speed away and circle overhead waiting to return.

Entrance to the Grove~
   A peaceful grove of mature forest stretches out, bordered on one side by a
thicket of dense pines.  Tall deciduous trees of every variety cast long trunks
towards the sky leaving the forest floor relatively open, while still
protecting it with a dense canopy of leaves.  Vines and undergrowth fill up the
empty spaces, creating concealment for small animals which dart about the
bushes.

   The forest is alive with the gentle activities of woodland creatures and the

fruit and budding plants is everywhere.  Roots run along the ground, breaking
up the otherwise even grade of the forest floor and roosting birds make
constant noise with their songs.

oblivious to danger, run up to passers by for a quick inspection before
running back into the undergrowth.

They are filled with juicy, red apples ripe enough to begin to fall all around
them onto the ground.  Without pruning the trees have somehow achieved a
perfect balance of branches for production while maintaining their wilderness
aesthetic.  Some apples are in little piles around the bases of the trees.

A Diseased and Dying Tree~
   Unlike the rest of the forest, one withered old willow tree appears to be
diseased and dying.  As the other trees creak in the wind, this tree groans and
cracks as large pieces of bark fall to the ground dry and dead.  Almost all of
its leaves are gone and its long drooping branches scratch at the dessicated
soil around its periphery.  The animals are absent from here, perhaps turned
away by the lack of balance this tree represents.

sounds of a dull creaking beyond the high bushes that obscure any line of
sight.  An incongruous odor, like rotten wood follows the breeze coming from
the same direction as the sounds.  A flock of crows soars far overhead,
disappearing frequently behind the leaves.  A cluster of bushes seems to have
been disturbed recently here.

Enveloped By Trees~
   The trees are particularly dense here and make movement very dificult.
Largely made up of sparse elms, smaller pine trees have filled the gaps
blocking visibility to no more that just an armlength.  The scent of pine
is overpowering but still invigorating, making the sensation of pine needles
scratching against exposed flesh almost tolerable.  In the distance can be
heard the sound of falling water.

of growth seems almost unnatural in its degree, and the branches are so well
joined as if the blockage was grown for that purpose.  However, throught the
cracks, nothing can be seen except more trees continuing off into the visible

multicolored wildflowers sprout all over, providing a bouquet of sweet smelling
aromas, and contrasting the deep green of the forest.  Here and there small
spots of grass are bent over indicating this to be a favorite place for the
inhabitants of the forest to come and sun themselves.

rains so as not to oversaturate the forest.  The trees make an abrupt end when
they reach the edge of the clearing, leaving an open and unshaded field.

themselves, hanging low to the ground near the base but also extending high up
into areas concealed by the canopy.  It stands alone, separated by some
distance from the nearest trees of the rest of the forest.  The branches are
interspersed in such a fashion as to allow the easy climbing of the tree.

soil and making it more arable.  Small animals take refuge within the stalks
which probide ample cover from hungry predators.  The plains continue on to the
limits of sight, the top of the grass waving together in the wind giving it the
appearance of ripples on the water.

Some Low Scrub Brush~
   A small stand of scrub brush nestles into the tall grass.  The stunted, tiny
leaved shrubs send down long roots into the ground to try to access the supply
of water which rests only a short distance below the surface of the plain.
Thorny branches prevent close inspection, but little birds nests are visible
resting within the protection the branches offer.

Treeless, Dry Plains~
   An arid and flat plain stretches out towards the horizon.  Tall, waving
grass covers the ground, broken up by patches of dusty, dry soil.  Although
seemingly inhospitable, it teams with life and activity.  Large animals can be
seen grazing on the grass as large scavenging birds soar overhead.  The strong
scent of pungent grasses overshadows the smell of passing herds.

   This spot has been ravaged over by some long past herd of grazing animals
that completely dug up and ate the grass completely to the roots.  Now only dry
soil remains and the dust is picked up by the wind and blown around in tiny
cyclones of swirling air.  At the edges, grass is starting to make a return,
but it will be many years before it will be fed upon again.

A Stretch of Open Field~
   The standard feel of the plain momentarily gives way to a stretch of greener
grass and the buzzing of insects.  Such extra growth has apparently been fed by
the slaughter of a large number of herd animals some time ago, their blood
fertilizing the soil.  Scattered bones lay about the ground and deep
indentations, likely caused by horses hooves cover the area.

Hummocks and hills~
   A small series of small hills breaks up the horizon and makes travel more
difficult.  Low grass and ground creeping vines cover the surface surrounding
innumerable prarie dog holes.  Many long, hard years have taught the little
animals to stick together in this colony for protection.  Your approach causes
loud squealing and the sound the sound of little feet scurrying down the holes.

   A high forested ridge looms overhead, sending down fresh woodland scents and
humid air in a stiff breeze.  Roots stick out of the sides of the eroded face
and several large trees have begun to keel over and lean towards the plain as
their footing gives way.  Loose piles of rock and soil form little ramps on the
sides of the ridge as detritus falls down from the slowly receding bank.

Entering the Pass~
   A ridge in the near distance begins to angle in towards an inhospitable
region of the plain.  Although the ridge looks to be climbable in some places,
it is easier to parallel it and stay out of an area of the plains that is blank
and featureless, increasing the possibility of getting lost.  Some distance to
the south, clopping hooves and calm voices can be heard.

save the prarie dogs.  Off to one corner of the tunnel there is a diminutive
hole in the side of the earthen wall, just large enough to fit an arm inside

a tiny finger on the edge of a large mountian range far to the south.  The rock
pinches off into a thin passageway that is blocked by a wooden gate which
completely seals the pass.  Although seemingly strong enough already, it
appears as though attempts are being made to further fortify it as additional
logs are stacked up all around.

   A beautiful view of the plains is offered here standing in the trees on top
of the long ridge.  The plant life here is healthy but appears dusty and
sunbaked, unlike the moist vitality of trees seen deeper into the woods.  
Erosion has taken its toll on the edge of the forest and many of the larger
trees have fallen over leaving deep holes in the ground where their roots were
pulled up as they fell.

have just recently fallen over of their own accord.

channel an armslength in depth for several paces along the edge of the ridge.
Many thick vines, tied to trees, lay coiled on the forest floor and look as
though they could be used to lower things over the edge.  Looking down, a stone
pass is apparent, blocked by a wooden gate probably constructed from the logs
taken from this forest.

Shuffling noises are easily heard coming from dark corners of the canyon and a
small slanted lean-to can be seen of to one side of the fire.

fallen down from the upper levels of sandstone and are strewn about the ground.
There are numerous heavy drag marks and twigs, likely the result from bringing

A Walkway Through the Trees~
   Brown leaves and pine needles litter the ground through a narrow passageway

leave many gaps and ultimately offer very little protection.  Bark is peeling
from the trunks indicating a lack of health, though not incorrectable with
proper care.  The forests sense of balance is wrong and the trees look forced

beauty and dignity.  Vines hang down in the way and must be pushed aside to

A Walkway Through the Trees~
   Brown leaves and pine needles litter the ground through a narrow passageway
between the trees.  They hang overhead forming a crude roof for shelter, but
leave many gaps and ultimately offer very little protection.  Bark is peeling
from the trunks indicating a lack of health, though not incorrectable with
proper care.  The forests sense of balance is wrong and the trees look forced
and stunted.

A Room Made of Piled Branches~
   A small room is constructed here from dead branches fallen from the trees,
rather than the structures which have been woven from the living fabric of the
forest.  Looking almost like a nest, the hovel is littered with detritus and
half eaten food.  Spiders and other insects crawl through the branches and ants
cover the floor.  The stale air is overpowering and it is very dim.

A Crude Stone Altar~
   Here at the end of the passage stands a large amorphous stone with a small
indentation on its top surface.  The foliage here appears to be slightly
healthier, but is still in a state of sickness.  Pieces of stone lay about the
altar yet to be removed and indicating that its construction is recent or
ongoing.  Small offerings of berries and flowers lay atop the stone covered in
light inscriptions.

A Pile of Stones~
   A wall of stones has been hastily erected between the trees blocking access
to whatever lies behind and the trees prevent passage around.  There are
curious scuff marks in the ground appearing as though something has been
dragged through here and behind the wall.  The reddish-brown sandstone wall is
poorly constructed and it may be possible to move some of it in order to
proceed.

The Top of the Steps~
   A set of natural field stone steps have been placed here to facilitate easy
travel down a steep slope into a deep gulley eroded into the ground between the
trees.  Tree roots uncovered by the erosion protrude out into the crevice
providing easy handholds so as not to lose balance while traversing the stones.
It does appear, however, that someone was not so lucky and blood marks the
stones near the bottom.

The Edge of the Glade~
   The forest borders here on the edge of a beautiful glade.  The trees are
slowly encroaching on the open space but do not extend out into the field
itself.  Birds dart out of the trees and into the clearing to snatch a small
morsel of food seen on the ground, to turn back just as quickly with their
prize and speed back into the trees.

A Hush in the Woods~
   The sounds of the forest begin to diminish for no apparent reason.  The air
is still and only a faint bird call can be heard in the distance, unlike the
cacophonous noise of life in the rest of the forest.  This change however does
not seem foreboding, but rather feels as though a reverent calm has been
imposed and the denizens of the woods respect this innately.

Through A Beautiful Archway~
   The trees have grown into grand architectural forms, most noticably a
stunning archway of woven branches and trunks.  Vines covered in flowers travel
up the sides and hang, traversing the span, to add to the natural beauty of the
site.  A calm presides over the air causing the rich forest aroma to linger
rather than be blown away by the breeze.

Approaching an Ancient Tree~
   The forest here appears to be at its most vibrant.  Trees and bushes burst
with color as little animals scurry about purposefully but in complete silence.
Beyond the nearby trees a clearing with a massive tree in its center can be
seen.  The tree extends into the canopy and out of view, hiding its uppermost
branches from view.

The Meeting Place~
   The branches and trunks of the trees are woven together here to form a
nearly solid wooden dome providing shelter and shade.  A large natural stone
with a flat surface rests in the center, encircled by numerous other smaller
stones that look somewhat like seats.  Curious writing is inscribed around the
edges of the center stone, and its sides appear worn and smooth as if leaned
upon for many years.

The Bottom of the Steps~
   Standing here a set of stone steps are apparent, leading up the side of a
steep gully.  A thin trickle of water flows through leaving the ground muddy
and sticky.  Birds fly down to pick worms out of the wet soil and small holes
are visible all along the high edges, likely the nests for small animals.  
Small patches of dried blood stain the last few steps an the mud is torn up by
something's passing.

A Damp and Cold Cell~
   A shallow cave has been tunneled out of the side of the gully.  Just large
enough for a few people, it appears as though someone has been living here for
quite some time.  Strangely, small animals slip through hole in the entrance
gate bringing berries and nuts, leaving them on the ground in a group.  A pile
of leaves sits in the corner, creating an uncomfortable place to sleep.
