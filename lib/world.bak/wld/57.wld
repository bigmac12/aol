A Wide, Cobbled Road~
   The closer you get to the tower, the more and more it's sheer size
overwhelms you.  Standing 1000 feet in the air, the massive size of it dwarfs
even some of the smaller mountains in the area.  It is a fitting protector of
the city of Palanthas, and it even seems to have the same type of regalness as
it's defenders, and brings to mind a knight standing guard duty.  There is
visible damage to the tower, miniarets crumbled, and parts of the massive outer
wall has been blasted open.  The main tower it self is blackened and scorched
in many areas.  The damage from the dragon war has still not been fixed, and
the gaping holes in the tower and walls fill you with awe as you imagine the
size and strength of the beasts needed to punch holes in the massive structure.

A Wide, Cobbled Road~
   As you approach the tower, the spur stands out.  Built as a way to guard the
road into Palanthas, the Knight's Spur is nothing more than a huge wall with
rooms in it.  The thickness of the wall, however, is the one factor that makes
the road so incredibly safe to attacks.

A Wide, Cobbled Road~
   This is a large hallway that leads from one entrance of the Knight's Spur to
the other.  It is kept clean of horse matter, as well as of garbage, and other
refuse.  The walls are made of marble, as is the floor and polished to a
gleaming shine.

A Wide, Cobbled Road~
   Here is a large guarded porticullis into and out of the Knight's Spur.  
From here you can venture out onto the Wings of Habbakuk, or into the spur.  
The porticullis is open and is very large.  It is not fully open, due to damage
to it.  You can see scratch marks on the metal, and several of the iron bars
have been torn out of it, or bent severely.

At a Fork in the Road~
   You stand on a large bridge that leads over a flowing river.  The small
river itself runs through the Knight's Spur, and is used to carry away refuse
and other trash.  There stands, on each end of the bridge, a knight, showing
you that they take this one possible weakness in the tower's defenses quite
seriously, and are well aware of it.

A Wide Road Along the Field~
   This is the entrance way from the Knight's Spur to the The High Clerist's
Tower itself.  It seems an easy way to enter the tower, though it is
undoubtedly well guarded.
