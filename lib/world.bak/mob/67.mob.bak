This is a young Qualinesti male, with almond-shaped eyes and angular features.
~
   The young man scans the horizon carefully, ever vigilant for any signs of
trouble.  He holds a finely crafted elven longbow, and a quiver full of arrows
hangs from his back.  His eyes are large and almond-shaped, and pointed ears
peek out from beneath his hair.  A leather band across his forehead holds the
hair from his eyes, and his angular face is smooth and tanned, from a life
spent out of doors.
