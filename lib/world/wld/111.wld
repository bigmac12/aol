A Circular Staircase Leading Into Darkness~
   As you enter this narrow, circular stairway the smell of rot and decay hits
your senses full force, making you gag.  The stones of the stairs are made from
a dark-grey, almost black stone.  Following these stairs downward leads you
into a cold, chilly darkness, and you feel as if you are being watched.

A Circular Staircase Leading Into Darkness~
   Continuing along this narrow, spiraling staircase leads you into cold, damp
darkness.  Every movement, every breath or whispered word seems to echo off the
walls, and the stench of decay wafts up from below.  The dark-grey stone of the
steps and walls glisten with moisture from the damp air.

A Circular Staircase~
   The darkness here lifts only slightly, lit dimly by some kind of flickering
light further down the steps.  The stones in this area cease to echo your
movements as badly, though it's just as cold and damp as before.  The sickly
sweet scent of death still hangs about, floating about in the cold air.

A Small Landing~
   The narrow staircase opens up here to a small, dimly lit landing.  The light
comes from a single, sputtering torch set into a rusted iron sconce on the far
wall, leaving flickering shadows everywhere.  Ocassionally, it seems as if sets
of red eyes peer at you from the darkness, but when you look they are gone.  A
human skeleton lies in the middle of the floor wearing a tattered blue robe,
and the flesh is still decaying.  A chunk of stone been broken off of the last
step and now lies a few inches away from the skeletal hand, where you notice
some deep scratches in the wall.  An odd thin white mist creeps over the floor
and down the stairs, adding to the chill of the place.

stone and moss.

At A Fountain Carved of Obsidian~
   This room is lit by low burning braziers, casting deep, eerie shadows upon
the already dark moss covered walls.  Along the walls are stone benches made
from polished obsidian, and in the center of the room stands a large, ornately
carved fountain of the same stone.  Stone gargoyles leer at you from the
corners of the room, their ruby eyes glittering in the dim light.  A deep,
rythmic chant echos from the north, and exits lead from this room in the four
cardinal directions.

   This large, obsidian fountain has been carved by skilled hands.  Rising from
the center like some black monolith, are three figures carved from the stone of
the fountain: A rotting corpse with a snarling, hideous goats head; A muscular
man wearing an executioners hood; and a roiling black cloud; each set with
small, delicate rubies for eyes.

   Moss hangs from each of these stone gargoyles, which sit in the four corners

and each ones eyes have been set with rubies.  The dim light from the braziers
reflects off their eyes making it look as if they were alive, watching..

evidently forgotten, as evidenced by the rusted mining tools lying about the
chamber.  Near the back of the room, a small cold spring flows through and
disappears under the far wall.

their hoods pulled low.  The entire dining hall is lined with torches set in
wall sconces to illuminate the whole room, and the moss that seems to cover the
walls of the rest of this structure looks to have been scraped away to keep the
them fairly clean.  The scent of roasting meats and other foods barely
overpower the scent of decay that floats in the air.

the west wall, and two large preparation counters lie against the south wall.
All kinds of meats lay out on the counters waiting to be prepared and pots of
stew cook on the oven.  Cooks come and go from the pantry to the north
retrieving ingredients for the meals being prepared, and the dining hall is to
the east.

   Atop this polished obsidian dais stands the altar to Morgion, god of disease
and decay.  The huge altar stands at waist level and looks as if it was charred

ceremonial candles, and a bowl of some black ichor.  On the back wall is a
giant likeness of Morgion himself, carved from the very stone of the walls.  
His black hooded head looms over the altar, peering down with large ruby eyes.

A Hallway~
   This This simple grey stone hallway is lit on either side by sputtering
torches set in wall sconces.  Vermin skitter underfoot and in the shadows,
their unnatural red eyes peering out from the darkness.  Moss hangs from the
walls, and these hallways seem seldom traveled compared to the rest of the
temple.  To the east is a priestess' quarters and strange muttering and
cackling can be heard from the south.

Arekan's Apothecary~
   A frail, wispy haired old man wanders about muttering to himself and
rearranging things in no apparent order.  A myraid collection of strange and
arcane items lie scattered about the place in utter dissaray, and dust lines
many of the shelves.  Hanging from the walls are richly decorated tapestries
woven with golden borders, and thick fur rugs lie across the floor.

It is quite difficult to keep a sound footing on this narrow landing which is
little more than a damp piece of stone that juts out from the cavern wall.  A
faint stream of light from above penetrates the darkness revealing solid ground
below.

A Mass Grave~
   The passage opens up to a huge natural rock cavern here, and the horrible
smell of decay and rot that filled the temple and hallways obviously comes from
this area.  Bones and rotted cloth and other material lie scattered about the
rough cavern floor, and just visible in the dim gloom are cold, long dead
corpses.  The entire area has been turned into a mass grave, and skeletons and
corpses of every race and size have been heartlessly discarded here.  Many of
the more recently deceased corpses bear signs of rent, melted or otherwise
mutilated flesh and some are twisted into agonizing, tortured postions.

   Thick vines hang from the ceiling here, each covered by a thick, sticky
slime and odd gargantuan sized flowers.  They are beautiful yet terrifying at
the same time and something doesn't seem natural about the size or shape of the
flowers.  Each resembles a great gaping mouth, their serrated edges looking
much like sharp teeth.  Vapors from the bubbling bog hang heavily in the air,
swirling about in a breeze of unknown origin.

long, trailing vines rises from the rolling fog and boggish footing here.  
Sturdy cressets have been driven deep into the soft ground providing evidence
that someone, or something, visits these caverns.  Each cresset is filled with
dried mosses which are set aflame to provide light, and the flickering flames
cast light over what appears to be a small crevice where many small scrapes can
just barely be made out.

A Room of Great Pain and Suffering~
   A long table stands in the center of the room.  Thin strips of leather have
been secured to the table to allow victims to be strapped into place.  There is
a fair bit of slack on the straps, however, so that the suffering thrashes of
the victim can be observed.  It is here that the bog's harvest is tested for
potency.  Unwilling to wait and study the affects of imbibing the toxic
concoctions, a quicker way to induce their affects has been devised.  Razor
sharp blades are used to strip off multiple layers of flesh and expose
vulnerable tissue.  The toxins are then applied to the victim while their
horrific affects are painstakingly documented.  A holding cell lies to the
northeast.

   Standing as a grand centerpiece to this gruesome display of inhumanity is
perhaps the cruelest of tortures known.  A towering gallows has been erected in
the middle of this imposing cavern.  Hanging from the crossbeam, where the
noose would be expected to be found, is a massive iron hook.  The iron is
heavily corroded and periodically a bit of blood drips from its surface to the
stained floor below.  Damnation to the hook involves having the point of the
hook pushed through one side of the belly and out the other, then being left to
hang.  Holding cells lie to the east, northeast, and southeast.

not even a kender.  It is pitch black, without even the faintest hint of light.
The prisoner locked in this room receives absolutely no human contact.  It is
vermin infested and filled with human excrement from those who have been left
here to die.  The many cockroaches and spiders that scurry across the floor
serve as the only source of food for anyone looking to prolong their stay.  
Water drips down the filthy wall and forms small puddles.  The monotonous drip
is completely unnerving in this otherwise silent environment.

A Room of Great Pain and Suffering~
   In the very center of this dank, smelly room is a long table with two giant
cranks attached at either end, more commonly known as the rack.  Attached to
the flat laying surface are six spiked rollers, designed to tear away flesh as
the victim is slowly, agonizingly stretched over a long period of time.  An
acrid odor reminiscent of ammonia and chlorine permeates the air, stinging your
eyes and nose.  A small steel bucket hangs above the table dripping some acidic
formula.  When a victim is on the rack, this acid eats away at skin, muscle and
tissue as they are being stretched adding to their pain and agony.  As it is
now, it splatters off of the table, stinging your flesh where it touches.  A
holding cell lies to the southeast.

other cells the walls of this small room bear crude tapestries depicting
Mishakal engaged in obscene acts, or more often than not her downfall.  Rusty
iron manacles are bolted to the back wall of the room to hold prisoners up

steel breastplate once bearing the symbol of Mishakal.  The cell itself is
vermin infested and filled with human excrement from those who have been left
here to die.  The many cockroaches and spiders that scurry across the floor
serve as the only source of food for anyone looking to prolong their stay, and

An Observation Deck~
   Originally intended to allow guards to keep an eye on prisoners, these
observation decks have become host to a rather macabre pastime.  A number of
people flock to these observation decks to watch the great horrors that
transpire below.  Granted, it is still possible to watch the prisoners from
this vantage point, but few who gather here pay any mind to the cells.  Wooden
benches have been set here and, oddly enough, tables bearing snacks.  Hanging
from the ceiling, just in front of the deck, is a steel bucket with a
funnel-shaped bottom.  A small rope extends from the partially opened cover at
the base of the funnel to the deck's railing.  Observers can use this rope to
further open the mouth of the funnel.

An Underground Riverbed~
   Appearing to have been forgotten for generations, all that remains of the
river that must have carved these caverns is a thin putrid stream.  The narrow
trickle of water still flows along its ancient bed.  Barely resembling what
anyone would call water, the murky flow has a sickening greenish tint to it,
presumably from sediment it has collected on its journey westward.

A Dank Cell~
   Used to push prisoners beyond the brink of insanity, this cell is extremely
small.  It has a low ceiling so that no one within can stand to full height,
not even a kender.  It is pitch black, without even the faintest hint of light.
The prisoner locked in this room receives absolutely no human contact.  It is
vermin infested and filled with human excrement from those who have been left
here to die.  The many cockroaches and spiders that scurry across the floor
serve as the only source of food for anyone looking to prolong their stay.  
Water drips down the filthy wall and forms small puddles.  The monotonous drip
is completely unnerving in this otherwise silent environment.

A Pile of Rotting Corpses~
   This huge natural rock cavern is completely immersed in darkness and has
been turned into a mass grave, with skeletons and corpses or every race and
size heartlessly discarded here.  Most of the bodies in this area are long
since decayed, and several types of mold and slime grow abundantly, testament
to the fact that few come here anymore.  A cold sense of dread hangs over the
place, as if you are being watched very closely.

   These once white marble steps lead to an abandoned temple.  Now fully
immersed in water the only way to reach the walkway beyound is to swim down
along them.  Slime and debris covers the warped white stone structure that can

   This walkway runs across the courtyard, leading into an abandoned temple.  
Intricately carved columns are erected on both sides, casting watery shadows on
the cold, once white marble floor.  A long dead garden can be seen on either
side of the walkway.  Its plants now drowned by enveloping water.  Where once
worshipers must have visited this temple for healing or protection, now all
that remains is the sight of corruption and decay.

An Underwater Alcove~
   Through the muck and filth of the water surrounding you can be made out a
large alcove flanked by two enormous marble columns.  The columns are in bad
condition, being chipped and discolored from age and the surrounding waters,
and seem somehow foreboding.  At the back of the alcove stands a large set of
double doors.  These once shining golden doors are now blackened and are
covered with innumerable molds, fungus and scum.  Large pull rings have been
attached to pull them open.

   This was once a magnificient hall made of white stones.  The stones
corrupted by time and water, are now blackened and covered with mould.  A
sickly green light penetrates the cracked and broken, glass dome above you.  
Broken marbles in dull colors spreads across the hallway that branches north,
east and west.  A large, golden double doors lies to the south it too has seen
the effects of the surrounding waters and it is tarnished to the point of
appearing green.

   Swimming along the center aisle in the temple that leads to the altar to the
north.  The floor is made of dull and cracked broken marbles that blend with
the dirty and blackened stone walls.  To the west and east are long, oaken pews
that were once filled with worshippers who would have prayed to the goddess of
this place.  Sickly green light streams through the glass dome above, casting
nauseating shadows on the muck strewn floors.

Dais at the Center of the Altar~
   Standing on what was once the most sacred and holy floor of the temple, a
statue of a woman in flowing robes occupies the middle of the dais.  This
horrifying piece of work stares blankly ahead, an expression of pain and
bitterness carved on its cracked features.  Waves of darkness flow out from the
statue causing fear and panic in even the most stout hearted.  The once white
walls have been torn and scratched by massive talons.  Also, chests scatter the
floor, their contents spilling into the muck and debris.

and what was once small cushions are now mere scraps of fabric drifting along
the floor.  Ahead is the main altar of the temple, and standing in the middle

downwards where they have started to form a thick layer.  The shrubs and

vegetation at your feet seems to have been recently disturbed, and the glint of
metal can be seen beneath a thin pile of leaves.

half-eaten food and grime, and looks to be the main eating area of this place.
