A Gracefully Arching Golden Bridge~
   The golden bridge curves gracefully between the watchtowers of the city,
spanning the entire western edge of the elven city of Qualinost.  Four towering
spires rise into the air at each corner, allowing the city guards to keep the
city safe from invasion or attack.  The city sprawls out within the confines of
the bridges, a few tall and brightly sparkling buildings rising high above the
rest.  The bridge continues north and south from here.
