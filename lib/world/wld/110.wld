A Pathway Leading up the Cliff~
   This pathway has been carved into the natural rock, winding its way up the
cliff face.  The steps are perfectly smooth.  In fact, they are so smooth that
it makes passage a rather slippery business.  The view of the bay is quite
stunning.  A white foam forms at the base of the cliffs as the waves slap
lazily against the rock.  Birds soar past as they float effortlessly on the
updrafts.  A few gnarled trees grow out of the side of the cliff, providing a
bit of shade.

At the Top of a Stone Stairway~
   A flat plateau at the top of the cliff provides a home to a grove of gnarled
trees.  Their massive trunks evidence their age.  Though the climate seems
inhospitable, they appear to have stood here for centuries.  Arcane runes have
been carved into the bark of nearly every tree.  Their meaning is not quite
clear to the average observer.  Perhaps they serve to welcome weary travellers,
or perhaps to warn them.

An Over-sized Kitchen~
   Even the most serious of mages must find time to fuel their bodies lest they
become to weak to perform the magic.  This ample kitchen can easily accommodate
the needs of the many visitors that frequent this tower as well as its regular
inhabitants.  A brick fireplace fills the entire eastern wall of the kitchen.
The hearth is home to large cauldrons and two ovens which are built right into
the brick.

The Main Hall of Master Xerxes Tower~
   The ceiling of this entryway is lost in the shadows overhead.  Judging by
the echo, it is several hundred feet above.  A soft glow from orbs that seem to
float in the air fill the room with their soft light.  Historically this tower
served as the home and private offices of Master Xerxes of the Order of
Nuitari.  However he now finds himself spending the bulk of his time at the
Tower of High Sorcery in Palanthas, and therefore has opened up the majority of
his tower for access to aspiring mages looking for a place to persue their art
away from prying eyes.

A Dark Laboratory~
   This laboratory is off limits to all visitors of the tower and to Ewalg as
well.  Only Xerxes himself knows just what breed of horrible and mystical art
is conjured here.  No book shelves or other items hang from the walls.  In
fact, the only decoration (if you can call it that) on the walls are large
runes which are difficult to read.  The writing seems to come in and out of
focus, perhaps staying in focus only for its creator.  In the center of the
stone floor a circle, just wide enough for one person, has been made from what
appears to be sea salts.

   The warmth of this chamber comes from carved, stone fireplace that is built
into the western wall.  The hard floor is covered with a plush carpet which
absorbs the sounds that would otherwise echo through this generously-sized
room.  Furnished with functionality in mind, the chamber serves as a meeting
place for visitors and students of magic.  High-backed chairs covered in
oxblood colored leather sit on either side of the hearth.  On the opposite side
of the room stands a round table surrounded by simple, wooden chairs.

   Ewalg is the main caretaker of the tower in Xerxes absence.  He has been
serving his master for years, choosing to continue his work here even after the
completion of his own Tests.  This chamber was set up as his study upon his
arrival here and has remained largely unchanged since.  It is outfitted with a
large desk of solid oak and a bookcase filled with volumes on herb lore and
anatomy.  An arched window in the wall behind his desk offers Ewalg an
excellent view of the bay.

but a small stream of light.  Charcoal colored carpeting covers the stone
floor.  The carpet is trimmed in a silver thread which gives the otherwise
simple item a sense or refinement.  An oaken bed stands against the eastern
wall.  It is dressed simply with a dark comforter and one pillow.  At the foot
of the bed stands a trunk which offers storage space for Ewalg's personal
effects.

with their crimson and silver light.  There is no doubt, though, that the
window was created to admit the dark glow of the black moon.

range from anatomy to history to herblore.  The spines of some of the books are

The End of the Hallway~
   The hallways stops here, switching off into two paths.  A bright, red light
glows from the end of the path to the right, while a soft white glow eminates
from the path to the left.  A large, black statue has been erected just a few
feet in front of you, and on its outstretched hand hangs a sign.

The Red Hallway~
   Wandering down the red path, there are several large red globes mounted on
the walls.  These must be the cause of the red glow.  The walls are no longer
smooth, but jagged and ugly.  The floor is now made of cobblestones, some of
which are missing.  Scurrying around the floor are what seems to be rats, but
who knows what kind of creatures live in this strange place.  There is a door
to the south.

   This large laboratory stinks of death, and looks just as bad.  Lined on all
of the large walls are shelves, on which stand what look to be body parts.  
Big, small, green, blue.  Every color and size, floating in jars of a strange,
watery liquid.  In the middle of the room lies a large, blood-stained operating
table, with straps and chains obviously used to keep the victim down.  In the
far right corner, there lies a rack of what looks like weapons.  Upon further
inspection, they look more like operating tools...

Entrance to the Academy~
   Delusen's Academy is renowned for being one of the most prestigious of
schools available to the aspiring mage, though from its interior, it may not
look as such.  It has the pleasant feeling of a home that has been well-
lived-in, with a large desk of oak that has been beaten with time and use
resting in the center of the room, awash in a mass of papers.  A small
fireplace lends the room a warm if somewhat stuffy feeling, and two comfortable
chairs, once very valuable before wear took its toll, sit facing the desk for
visitors to rest in while they wait to be seen.  The door to the west has a
slight draft blowing under it -- most likely the exit -- and there are doors to
the north and south as well.

filled with books of loose papers, others still half-empty, waiting for new

table suited only for resting papers on holds a single, half-melted candle at
its edge, by the look of it not used often for work during the night.

wall, opens up into a large room.  The hallway continues north and south.

reception area of the Academy.  The other hall, running east and west, is
uncarpeted and bare of furnishings of any sort, and is short and unnecessarily
thin.  To the south is a plain door with a shined brass handle, and upon the
door the words, "Master's Study," are inscribed, tooled by a hand most likely
now long dead.

words are too small to read from this distance.

Master's Study~
   The Master's Study is a small room, without much decoration but with a
comfortable feeling to it, anyhow.  Books sit open-faced on the thick red rug
covering the floor, as the shelves against the stained wooden walls are filled
to capacity, except for one against the east wall with just a single book
missing from its top shelf.  In the center of the room is a large desk with
many drawers, some of them opened.  Across the desk is a long, thin piece of
parchment that stretches across a stack of books, papers, and a long quill
underneath.  It's covered with a mixture of symbols and Common script, written
with a hasty but exact hand.  To the west and north are doors leading out.

disciples of magic to master, proper lettering takes years to internalize.  In
this corner of the lettering room, there are various books from which the
student may learn and practice from, as well as a small scroll issued to every
novice to work upon, both of which may be checked out, providing the bookkeeper
allows it.

Before the Storage Shelves~
   Here a number of books on the topic of lettering adorn a pair of cedar
shelves, each focusing on a different area, from how to construct the basic
alphabet, to finessing the perfect curves that are so vital in written magic.
Here, too, are various tightly-bound scrolls, each with a student's name
written over their curled edges.  An extension of a desk blocks the way south
to the tables at which students work, presumably to prevent anyone from taking
anything without the bookkeeper knowing.

Lettering Tables~
   These tables are set out for free student use, only sometimes with
supervision of one of the Academy's mages.  Each is marked with lines and blots
of ink from students' mistakes made off of the paper.  In the center of each
table is a box containing freshly-cut quills and sealed inkpots, ready for use.
Away from the already quiet lettering rooms are private study areas for
students wishing to concentrate fully.

A Private Room~
   This chamber has been set aside for students who wish to get away from the
rest of the Academy and study in quiet.  The air has a musty smell to it, as
little fresh air makes its way here.  The room has no decoration to speak of
other than a table, two chairs, and a candle by which to read.

A Drafty Hallway~
   This hallway carries a cold draft along the floor, from a source unknown.  
It adds a very uncomfortable feeling to the area.  This portion of the Academy,
from the looks of the carefully-fit high stone walls done in a style too old
for any times recent, seems to be the most ancient, as if it were left over
from an estate.  A large window against the south wall looks out into a wild,
grassy field, the image marred somewhat by a long crack running down one pane.

The drab hallway ends at a large portrait of a wizard in an overly-flattering
pose.

A Small Intersection in the Drafty Hallway~
   The hall splits four ways here, to the west and east leading into large
rooms; the library and an area for the instructors, respectively.  South, the
hall runs up to a cracked window and an exit to another room, and in the north,
a somewhat gaudy, overdone portrait of an old wizard hangs.  The old stone
walls in this area are blanketed with a cold draft that seems fitting,
considering their appearance.

Before a Portrait~
   Dominating the majority of this hallway's end is a large oil painting,
framed in something resembling gold.  The portrait is of a wizard in long white
robes that sag about his muscular body, too muscular for a man his age.  He
carries a tall wooden staff with a golden tip in one hand, and a blue spellbook
in the other, his eyes wide with fiery triumph.  His foot rests on the corpse
of what has to be the most astoundingly large red dragon in all of history.  
It is difficult not to laugh somewhat while looking at the ridiculous scene.  
A handful of chairs sit around a small table here, apparently there so that
students may also partake in laughing at the picture as well.

Just Inside the Academy Library~
   A strange, awkward presence fills this area near the arch that leads out
into the hallway, as if there is a rift between the hall and library.  The air
is stuffy, warm, and smells of hundreds of old volumes sitting in their
shelves, waiting to be read, feeling much different than any other part of the
Academy.  Shelves of heights twice that of a minotaur are lined in the center
of the room and against every available area of wall space.

Corner of the Library~
   The only bookshelves in this far corner of the library are against the wall,
with a ladder leaning up against one to allow access to the volumes higher up.
Large tables, many with students at them poring over the old books, dominate
this area.  The larger part of the library extends northward.

In the Academy Library~
   Between the shelves of the magnificent library that the Academy is so
well-known for, it is hard not to have a sense of awe over all the knowledge
that has been gathered in one place.  The books have a pleasant, musky odor of
pages that have seen their time, and then some.  The soft murmur of students
discussing their studies in the background mixes with the faint splash of pages
turning all through the library.

recently-bound, and carry titles suggesting they may deal with experimental
forms of magic.

Corner of the Library~
   The library meets at a corner here.  There is a small, low table with a
bench sitting underneath it that does not look as though it has been used much.
Out of the main area, this portion of the library is not as noisy, but not as
bright, either, as the main source of light is at the entrance.  Off to the
east is a dark nook with walls on three sides of it.  The books contained there
seem as though they have not been touched in ages.

An Undisturbed Portion of the Library~
   The first thing you notice coming into this area is a strong magical
presence.  Even those untrained in the arts can sense it from a few feet away.
It surrounds every inch of this dark, tucked-away area, emanating from the
books on the small shelves here.  Each tome is covered in a thick layer of
dust, untouched for months or years, and each one without title.  They must all
carry power to them, and with power, great danger, to give off such a crude,
forceful aura.  The rest of the library to the west seems cheery in contrast to
this drab, haunting side-room.

A Congregation Room~
   Proving once more what an odd conglomeration of buildings and add-ons the
Academy is, the stone of the western wall runs straight to thick redwood along
the south wall, which leads out of doors by means of a matching door with a
large window pane.  The room itself appears to be an area where the instructors
of the Academy may relax and meet for informal discussions.  It is littered
with cushioned chairs and tables, though has little ornamental decoration.  
There is a door to the north set in another peculiar redwood wall.

An Outdoor Brick Pathway~
   A brick path runs down the center of this small outdoor area, covered mostly
in dirt and mud.  A fence runs around the eastern edge to keep anyone from
simply strolling in, but it doesn't seem necessary, considering the open
countryside.  The path runs northward to the inside of the Academy, and south
to a small conservatory.

   This conservatory is quite small, but well-maintained.  Tall glass panes are
set between beams, making up the walls, meeting at a slant at the roof.  When
the sun is out, the brilliance of the light inside is remarkable.  The area
smells thickly of the plants and soil within it, with many rare and unusual
species clustered mostly near the center.  A path to the north leads back to
the Academy.

Collection of Offices~
   Three somewhat makeshift offices of the school's instructors have been made
out of this room.  Separated only by floorspace, each is stacked with papers.
One maintains what looks like a well-ordered system, while the other two are a
fairly chaotic swamp of written words.  Students come in from time to time to
talk with their teachers, but usually the offices are vacated, as most of the
time is spent helping those who need it.

   At first glance, one could almost take this to be a storage area, with
stacks of books and a few large shapes covered by sheets near the edges.  
However, in the center of the room is a wooden stand with a glass chamber atop
it.  It stands about five feet tall, with 4 plain wooden legs to support it.  
The chamber has a small door leading out.

   This wing of the Academy is dedicated to the students which support it.  
Those that can afford it live and eat here, dedicating their young lives
entirely to the study of the magic arts.  North is the sleeping hall, which, in
the evening hours, becomes the social center of the compound.  South is the
mess hall, offering its selection of "fine cuisine."

the most bustling place in the Academy.  Both students and their instructors
eat here, though the Mages tend to keep to themselves for the most part.  An
aroma that is faintly pleasant drifts in from the kitchen.  A stream of
conversation flows heavily in the high-roofed area, making it disorienting at
times.

   The wonderful smells of home cooking drift from this kitchen, almost
palpable in their intensity.  Though the Academy may be in disrepair here and
there, they seem to at least be committed to providing good food to eat -- most
likely because the instructors themselves eat it as well as students.  During
meal times, lines form here and diners are allowed to choose what they wish to
have served into their large, partitioned bowls.

bit of light and fresh air can let in from the small windows near the roof, but

their old books, but the mildewed tomes seem to be strongly warded and prevent
any from touching them.  The rest of the room is occupied by a plain, solid
table, with a few half-completed strange metal gadgets that look like the work
of a gnome.  There is an archway to the north, leading into darkness.

   Immediately upon entering this cell, an exasperated feeling of unease mounts
inside of it, followed by a flash of terror.  Something is not right inside
here -- something horrible has been done or is about to be done, but it is
impossible to tell what it is.  The prison is completely barren, and dark as
the bowels of the earth.  A sudden chill cracks at the air and is gone in the
next moment.
