An Endless Expanse of Desert~
   The ground here is covered with dry, jagged stones varying in size from
small pebbles to fist sized rocks.  The brittleness of these stones make it
obvious that no rain has fallen here for many ages.  Looking around the area
you find that things look distorted by the heat haze that rises off the ground.
Anyone who wishes to travel this land would be well advised to bring lots of
water with them unless they want to become a dehydrated corpse.

   Small brittle stones and a lot of sand fill this area with more sand
stretching off to the west where a few dunes start to take shape.  The heat
haze constantly rising off the ground gives everything an odd, distorted look.
The only sound that disturbs the deathly still of this area is that of the dry
wind as it moves across this desert.  Anyone who wishes to travel through this
land would be wise to bring a lot of water with them.  Immediately to the south
a large outcropping of rock looks like it might provide some shade for those
seeking rest.

   During the daytime hours the heat is so oppressive in this desert that
travel is grueling, at best.  Each footstep seems to sink deeper and deeper
into the sand which stir in the hot breeze.  A few pebbles and larger rocks
break up the otherwise barren landscape of the area.  There is little life
here, and the few animals that do call this area home are less than hospitable.

A Roughly Cut Path Along the Moat~
   This roughly cut path follows the curve of the moat which surrounds the city
of Solanthus.  Its murky waters lap lazily at the curtain wall just beyond it.
The moat is no doubt rather deep, combining with the massive structure of the
wall to create a formidable defensive perimeter for the Solamnic capital.  The
grasses and reeds that normally grow alongside the waters have been trampled by
those who follow this route rather than travelling through the city itself.

Just off a Roughly Cut Path~
   Most of the grasses growing in this area have been trampled, though a few
stray cattails and other tall plants have managed to survive.  In the center of
the clearing a circle of small stones, surrounding the charred remains of some
wood, serve as evidence that this area was perhaps used as a campsite.  Deep
boot prints in the soft ground lead in various directions, making it nearly
impossible to ascertain how large of a group the clearing played home to.

A Squared Off Section of Dead Grass~
   Four wooden stakes remain in the soft ground here, marking the corners of a
square of dead grasses.  Perhaps a band of travellers recently set up camp
here.  The moist ground is littered with bits of rubbish which would be enough
to send the Warders of Solanthus into a fit if they were to see such a mess.  
A few low mounds of dried grass have been stacked within the square, providing
a comfortable place to rest.

Wandering Amidst the Plains~
   You stand amidst the flowing plains of southern Solamnia.  The grass around
you is rather tall, having been left to grow for countless summers and winters.
The grass is slightly yellowed, having been scorched by the sun of the plains.
Travel is not particularly difficult, though navigation is a little more
challenging.  Two landmarks present themselves amongst the endless expanse of
southern horizon.  There is a city quite some ways to the northwest, and in the
distance to the east, a fair-sized wooden structure can be seen.

A Wide Path on the Plains Surrounding a Wooden Pallisade~
   You are walking alongside the fifteen-foot walls of a hastily-erected wooden
pallisade.  The outer walls are made of tightly-spaced wooden logs, lashed
together to form a wall and driven into the ground.  Looking up, you can see a
few men pacing back and forth on the battlements, as well as a few flags of
white, blue, and green fluttering in the breeze.  All around you are the
endless plains of southern Solamnia, and you can see for quite some ways in any
direction you should care to look.  The only real disruption of your
uninterrupted view of the horizon is the city of Solanthus, rising up
majestically to the northwest.  The path continues around the pallisade, and
also leads off to the west and southwest.

grass is slightly yellowed, having been scorched by the sun of the plains.  
Travel is not particularly difficult, though navigation is a little more
challenging.  Two landmarks present themselves amongst the endless expanse of
southern horizon.  There is a city quite some ways to the northwest.  To the
east, the nature of the wooden structure becomes a little clearer.  It looks
like a pallisade of some sort, and it is manned by a small number of men.  You
can smell smoke from somewhere nearby.

Before the Gate of a Small Wooden Pallisade~
   Rising disruptively above the smoothe lines and endless horizon of the
plains is a small, hastily constructed wooden fortress.  Around you, you hear
the sounds of commotion as armed men in mercenary uniforms mill about,
conducting their business and seeming to have a fairly fun time of it.  Mixed
in with the odd shouted insult or clank of a playful swordfight is the loud
clink of drinking glasses being raised in toast to triumphs of the past.  
There is a fairly well-worn path through the trampled grass that leads south,
and also north through the wide wooden gate of the Pallisade.  A few blue,
green, and white flags are displayed proudly upon the walls.

A Wide Path on the Plains Surrounding a Wooden Pallisade~
   The fifteen-foot walls of a hastily-erected wooden pallisade tower overhead.
The outer walls are made of tightly-spaced wooden logs, lashed together to form
a wall and driven into the ground.  Looking up, you see a few men that pace
back and forth on the battlements.  There are numerous flags of white, blue,
and green fluttering in the breeze.  All around are the sweeping plains of
Southern Solamnia.  The city of Solanthus rises up over the horizon to the
northwest.  The path continues from here around the pallisade, with another
path leading off to the northeast.

   Rising some fifteen feet above you are the wooden walls of a hastily-erected
pallisade.  The walls are made of tightly-spaced wooden logs, tied together and
driven deep into the ground.  There are several men in white and blue uniforms
pacing atop its walls.  There are also a few flags fluttering carelessly in the
breeze.  The plains extend all around to your north, east, and west, making the
pallisade stand out like the proverbial sore thumb.  Some ways off to the
northwest, you can see the nearby city of Solanthus, the Solamnic capital.  A
beaten path continues to the northeast, and around the pallisade walls to the
southwest and southeast.

Upon the Wind-Swept Plains~
   You stand in the middle of an expansive grass field, extending all around
you.  The grass rises to just above the knees.  The occasional breeze stirs up
the odd grasshopper, fluttering obnoxiously past your face.  The breeze is warm
and refreshing, carrying upon it the scent of grass and fertile soil.  The
plains continue some ways around you, leading back to the highway to the
northeast.  Some ways to the southwest, you can see a wooden structure standing
above the grass, and a few tendrils of smoke like one would see from a
campfire.

Upon the Wind-Swept Plains~
   You are surrounded by a sea of yellowish-green grass, scorched by the sun
but still in full summer growth.  It rises just above the knees, tickling bare
skin.  A warm breeze from the south carries the fragrant smoke from a cooking
fire, and off in that direction, you can see a lone wooden structure rising up
from the otherwise flat landscape.  Some ways off to the northwest as well you
can see a city.  To the northeast, you can see a road of some sort.  A warm
breeze blows by, sweeping up hair and clothing alike, unimpeded by tree or
wall.

Inside the Small Wooden Pallisade~
   You have entered a hastily constructed pallisade, a temporary structure
often used by besieging armies as a base of operations when more permanent
buildings are not available.  The walls are about two men high, and are made of
sharpenned logs driven into the ground and lashed together.  They are supported
by strong wooden planks.  Looking closely, very few iron spikes are all that
hold the thing together, but it nonetheless seems rather sturdy.  Uniformed
mercenaries wander about, some armed, some not.  They do not seem to be in a
high state of emergency.  It would almost seem as though they were just camping
out.  There is a rickety ladder against the northern wall which leads up to the
wooden curtain of the upper level.  There is a wide gate to the south through
which most traffic seems to come and go.

Approaching a Raucous Campsite~
   There is some commotion in the area, as numerous mercenaries are camped out
here.  Judging from how worn the walking path is, and how much refuse is lying
about, they have been camped here for some time.  To either side of the path
there are various piles of timber, springs, rope and iron rivets, the remains
of disassembled siege machinery.  There is some smoke to the south, evidence of
an open camping fire.  There are tents all around, most of them quite small,
save for one larger pavillion tent a short distance to the southwest.  The path
continues south, and north toward the pallisade.

A Campfire Within a Circle of Tents~
   The grass here has been plucked, pulled, scythed, and trampled, the sign of
an encampment that has been here for some time.  In the center of the clearing
is a large firepit, around which sit a few mercenaries who are at various times
drinking, cooking their food, or sharing exaggerated tales of their exploits on
the battlefield or in their bedrolls.  There are numerous small tents all
around, and a few of them seem to be occupied.  The mercenaries are a rowdy
bunch, and perhaps it is their boozing and boorish behavior that led them to be
evicted from the city and forced to make camp out here on the plains.  There is
a trail that leads north toward a wooden pallisade.

tent has been treated with wax to waterproof it, and is colored in wide
alternating stripes of blue and white.  There are a few bedrolls about, and but
one comfortable-looking cot, and this is where the mercenary commander sleeps
in her off hours.  There are numerous discarded tankards and bottles lying
around, proof of this unit's penchant for having off-duty hours that are just
as active and rowdy as their time spent in battle.  There is a tentflap that
can be opened to permit re-entry to the outside.

The Upper Level of the Pallisade~
   You stand upon a sturdy wooden curtain along the top of the pallisade.  The
logs that constitute the wall, with their ends sharpened to points to impair
scaling are about three feet high above the curtain, allowing all but the very
shortest of gnomes and kender to look over with ease.  A few mercenaries wander
about, not really watching for anything in particular, though your presence
seems to have attracted some attention.  From here, you can see across the
plains and can clearly note the skyline of the city of Solanthus rising
majestically tot he northwest.  A rickety ladder leads back down from here.  
The curtain extends partway around the pallisade, permitting those who patrol
the wall to see in most directions.

   The large clearing is awfully noisy.  Enormous objects made of wood can be
seen just off to the south.  The immediate area is covered with loose pieces of
parchment held down to the ground with sizeable stones.  The parchments
themselves have peculiar drawings drawn on them as well as various scribbles
that only the person who has written them can decipher.  The forest continues
to the west, while a small path has been carved out of the carpet of parchment
that litters the ground.

Before Two Massive Wooden Structures~
   This part of the clearing is in utter chaos.  Gnomes dressed in all manner
of clothing and colors rush about either taking notes, maintaining the
machinery, or preparing to test the machines.  Fast talking gnomes run by
screaming last minute instructions, while others yell out questions to each
other in an equally fast pace.  Any who aren't used to the mannerisms of gnomes
would be overwhelmed by the outright chaos present in this area.

being launched from the completed machinery to the west.  Strangely shaped
tools can be found everywhere, either broken or whole.  Many of the tools have
things added onto them which, more often than not, are the reason why so many
of them are broken.

shape while others are left in their natural state.  Odd looking tools lay
about the area, some of them broken.  The broken ones are unlike any tools that
have ever been created.  Gnomes can be seen scurrying about talking at an
extremely fast pace with each other as they argue over the size of lumber and
the best way to cut them.

rekindle a patron's faith anew.  A statue, made of a strange blue stone, sits
in a alcove chipped into southern rock wall.  A small ring of stones, the size
of which someone could sit in, lays just before the alcove.

A Natural Pathway Into the Forest~
   A natural pathway wound its way north, guarded on each side by a variety of
trees, from oaks to pines.  Birds chirp in the canopy of the forest in harmony
with the rustles of small animals in the undergrowth as if to an unseen song.
The forest seems natural yet it is not overgrown, more as if it is trimmed by
unseen diligent gardeners.  The forest parts slightly to the northwest and to
the northeast.

Beneath a Fallen Tree~
   The song of the birds seem to be hushed in this part of the forest, as if in
mourning.  The plants about this part of the woods seem trampled and ravaged as
if an attemp at vicious woodcutting.  A large pine tree lies fallen, covered
mostly in undergrowth as the forest gradually heals its grevious wounds.  A
strange light comes from the northwest and a faint track leads southeastward.

E
fallen pine tree~
   Moss covers this fallen, once magnificent pine tree as it lays undisturbed
on the forest floor.  Roughly hewn cuts like those of a dull axe, surround the
bottom of the trunk, hinting to what had brought this beautiful forest giant
down.

An Eerily Silent Grove~
   Almost absolute silence lies across this section of the forest, one that not
even the song of birds breaks.  The vibrant colour of the trees are muted and
darkened as if they are in mourning.  A darkness permeates around the area,
except from an otherworldly shaft of green light that descends from the heavens
to light shine apon a pile of overgrown stick-shaped objects.  A space between
the trees leads southeast.

Before a Small Cavern~
   Short grass grows abundantly in this small natural clearing amidst the dense
foliage of the forest.  Tracks of various unknown animals crisscross the
clearing, the most prominent being the large ones leading to a cave to the
north.  The entrance to the small cavern yawn open like an abyss, as if a mouth
of the earth itself, blending well into the shadows of the ancient trunks.  A
faint animal trail leads to the southwest.

A Malodorous Cavern~
   A musky stench emanates from this small cavern which is most obviously a den
of some creature.  Deep gouges are clawed into the walls and ground of the cave
from the obvious occupant.  Bones and other refuse from previous meals are
scattered around the cavern's interior.  A gap in the rock is into the south
wall.

Along the Forest Pathway~
   The path continues meandering on its way north, blending well into the
forest undergrowth.  Shadows of the forest's topmost leaves dance along the
path as the gentle sigh of the wind rustles them gently in nature's wondrous
song.  On occasion a pair of eyes peer from behind the growth, yet they
disappear quickly when they are noticed.

Before a Large Clearing~
   As the path makes its way northward, the deep green foliage of the forest
gives way to the grass of a large natural clearing.  The song of nature still
continues yet the notes are subtly changed, replaced are the leaves' rustle for
the soft sigh of the wind against the grass.  In the north, a circle of
standing stones can be seen, the apperant destination of the path.  An arm of
the magnificent forest juts northward to the west.

A Quiet Secluded Grove~
   This thick grove of trees is serenely quiet, with only the sounds of the
forest and its inhabitants permeating the gentle silence.  The vegetation of
this grove seems to be trimmed and well tended yet it still has the element of
nature's chaos.  The large branches of an ancient oak tree drape prominently in
this small grove.  The forest spreads thinner to the east in a small trail.

E
ancient oak tree~
   An ancient oak tree grows in this small secluded grove, its branches rising
into the tallest reaches of the forest canopy.  Druidic runes that resemble
leaves are rather grown then carved into the old tree's trunk.  The bark seems
to visibly pulsing with life and warmth as if the tree welcomes your presence
yet that could change if any harm is brought these woods.

The Bottom of a Low Hill~
   The path continues into the small natural clearing and climbs up the slope
of a low rising hill.  This small hilltop is crowned with beauteously carved
monoliths of smooth gray granite which seem to have some markings on them.  
The song of the plains and woods seem to grow intermingled and soothing, as if
the earth itself rejoices.  The path leads north to the circle of monoliths and
south towards the forest.

Within the Circle of Standing Stones~
   As the path arrives to its destination withing the circle of stones, the
beauty of this place spreads a soothing feeling serenity.  The dolmen that make
up the stone circle are made of flawless smooth gray granite whose luster
shines in both the light of the moon and sun.  Intricate runic lines of druidic
script glow softly across the surface of the gray stone as if they are
themselves alive.  The song of nature seems the most glorious here, from the
tinkling of the water to the soft sigh of the wind to the warbling harmony of
the birds.  The path leads south down the hill, curling gently down the slope.
