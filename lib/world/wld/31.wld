The Foothills of the Khalkist Mountains~
   The steeper inclines of the mountain top start to give way to gentler hills.
The landscape is still dominated by trees, yet there seems something different
- almost enchanted- about them.  Their graceful movements and gentle rustling
create a feeling as though they were actual sentient beings, standing watch
over the miles of forest that stretches out in all directions.

The Foothills of the Khalkist Mountains~
   The soft bubbling of crystal waters mingles with the rustling of the tree
leaves.  The clear waters come from an ancient spring that lies deep within the
mountains.  It pools in a natural bowl formed in the mountains just north of
this spot.  Weeping willows grow along its bank, bending their branches down as
if taking a drink of the pure waters.  To the west the waters snake their way
down the hillside.

The Foothills of the Khalkist Mountains~
   A crystal clear river snakes its way south and east through the foothills.
It is graced on both sides by ancient willows and aspens.  The leaves of the
trees rustle in the breeze which blows down from the mountains.  In the
daylight the area is lit by sunshine which filters through the light canopy
overhead.  At night the light of Solinari illuminates the area with His silvery
glow.

Silvanesti Forest~
   The rolling hillside begins to level as the forest becomes the dominant
feature of the landscape.  Ancient trees, graced with a silvery bark, reach
their limbs up toward the heavens creating a dense canopy overhead.  Barely
perceptible paths, which could only be animal trails, wind their way between
the massive trunks.  The forest to the west, however, appears to be completely
impenetrable.

   The ground here is a bit more even than the area to the north, yet the same
enchanted feeling fills the air.  The birds sing their cheerful tunes as they
skip amongst the branches of aspen trees which appear to be as old as time
itself.  Their broad boughs are raised towards the heavens as if in praise.  
The light canopy which they create filters both the sun and moonling creating a
magical glow that is quite captivating.

At a Crossing of the Thon-Thalas River~
   A low, wooden bridge crosses this narrow stretch of the Thon-Thalas River.
Also known as the Lord's River, the Thon-Thalas is only a few feet deep here as
it begins its journey from the foothills of the Khalkist Mountains to the
Turbidus Ocean.  On both sides of the river graceful aspen trees extend their
boughs up to the heavens.  Their lush foliage creating a canopy which rustles
lightly in the breeze.

Along the Banks of the Thon-Thalas River~
   Only a marshy field of grasses separates the forest from the Thon-Thalas
River.  Graceful trees grow right up and over the river bank: some of their
roots disappearing beneath the waters of the river itself.  The faint rustling
of animals moving through the underbrush combines with the soothing sound of
the current to create a peaceful and serene environment.

Silvanesti Forest~
   The ancient aspens which stand guard in this land seem almost alive as they
sway lightly in the breeze.  The rustling above is no doubt the result of this
swaying, though perhaps it is the sound of some woodland animal who makes its
home in the lush tree branches overhead.  The ground between the trees is
almost completely covered with thick underbrush making travel here rather
cumbersome.

   The trees tower above but no absence of light is noticed.  It is as if the
trees move to afford better lighting wherever the traveler stands.  The path
ahead travels from East to West in a straight line the trees seemingly growing
to suit the path rather than the other way round.  Many rope bridges and
lookout towers can be seen in the trees and are doubtless populated by the most
expert elven archers in case of any threat to the elven homeland.

Silvanesti Forest~
   The sense of abundance and peace and tranquility that dominates the rest of
the forest seems to be absent here.  It is still dominated by lush foliage, yet
somehow different: more in the way the the surrounding area feels than how it
looks.  The ground is littered with twigs, rocks, and vines in an arrangement
that seems more intentional than not.

   The mass of leaves and vines which cover the forest floor is so much denser
here than anywhere else, that you cannot help but wonder if they were placed
here intentionally.    

   Upon closer inspection, you notice some writing carved into the rocks
and dirt.  To those able to read the language of magic their meaning is clear:
BEWARE.  Much of the writing is covered, perhaps moving the debris will
reveal the rest.

area seem lighter and more lovely than any other forest on the face of Krynn.

Before a Small Village~
   The river all but encircles this stretch of forest which is far less dense
than the surrounding area.  It is no wonder that the elves found this an
inviting area to build a village.  A wide stretch of the Lord's River makes an
arc just north of the village, while another branch meanders its way to the
south and west.  A thick hedge forms a wall of sorts around the village proper.
An opening in the dense shrubbery, flanked by two tall aspens, provides
entrance to the village itself.

their way between the massive trunks.  The forest to the west, however, appears

after the departure of the Qualinesti to bar the outside world.  Small forest

an excellent job.  Staring off in the distance, through the tree tops, a faint
glimmer to the southwest may very well be the fabled crystal dome of Tower
Shalost.

   A magnificent low slung bridge has been skillfully created from the marble
that is native to this part of Silvanesti.  Rather than quarrying blocks of
marble for use in this structure it appears as though the craftsman have carved
the bridge from the living rock itself.  Though the bridge is rather low, there
is still ample room for a raft or a canoe to pass underneath.  The bridge is
bordered on both sides by a polished marble railing which is home to several
torches which not only provide light but add to the natural beauty of the area
when their light is reflected in both the marble and the surface of the river.

Silvanesti Forest~
   The heady scent of maple, elm, birch and various other trees permeate the
air.  Their colored leaves paint a tapestry of rich golds and luscious greens.
Life seems to thrive in the enchanting forest where insects buzz and birds call
to one another high above the forest floor.  The forest is protected from any
harsh weather because of the thick network of leaves and branches that form the
roof of the forest.

Along the Banks of the Thon-Thalas River~
   Only a marshy field of grasses separates the forest from the Thon-Thalas
River.  Graceful trees grow right up and over the river bank: some of their
roots disappearing beneath the waters of the river itself.  The faint rustling
of animals moving through the underbrush combines with the soothing sound of
the current to create a peaceful and serene environment.

Silvanesti Forest~
   The path narrows quite a bit here as plant-life from either side close in on
it.  Though not really choking the path, it does prove to be some discomfort
for travelers who seek a way through.  The sky can barely be seen through the
thick canopy above.  The trees that line either side of the path seem to lean
their branches over the path, creating a sort of leafy roof that protect any
travelers from the weather.

Silvanesti Forest~
   Soft, musical chirping of songbirds can be heard drifting down from the
treetops.  The magical woods spread out on either sides of the path.  The
tranquil forest is filled with colors ranging from verdant greens, golden
yellows, and flaming reds.  The wildflowers are small explosions of color that
are scattered about the area, their pleasing aromas filling the air.  To the
southeast the tops of what appear to be marble towers can be seen amongst the
treetops.

Along the Banks of the Thon-Thalas River~
   The graceful aspens of the Silvanesti forest grow right up to the banks of
the Thon-Thalas river.  The trees along the bank appear to be quite young, at
least when compared to their ancient counterparts in the denser regions of the
wood.  The river splits here as it winds around the island which contains the
elven city of Silvanost.  To the southeast the tops of what appear to be marble
towers can be seen amongst the treetops.

   The graceful aspens of the Silvanesti forest grow right up to the banks of
the Thon-Thalas river.  The trees along the bank appear to be quite young, at
least when compared to their ancient counterparts in the denser regions of the
wood.  The tops of large rocks jut out from beneath the river's surface
creating white rapids which make the river quite impassable in this region.

Silvanesti Forest~
   The trees tower above but no absence of light is noticed.  It is as if the
trees move to afford better lighting wherever the traveler stands.  The path
ahead travels from East to West in a straight line the trees seemingly growing
to suit the path rather than the other way round.  Many rope bridges and
lookout towers can be seen in the trees and are doubtless populated by the most
expert elven archers in case of any threat to the elven homeland.

Silvanesti Forest~
   Ancient aspens, seemingly as old as the world itself, keep silent vigil over
the surrounding area.  Their mighty bows form a thick canopy overhead, blocking
out much of the sky above.  A dense thicket of brush at the base of the trees
makes for difficult - but not impossible - travel.  The leaves rustle softly as
a breeze, or perhaps a small animal, moves through them.

Silvanesti Forest~
   The ancient aspens which stand guard in this land seem almost alive as they
sway lightly in the breeze.  The rustling above is no doubt the result of this
swaying, though perhaps it is the sound of some woodland animal who makes its
home in the lush tree branches overhead.  The ground between the trees is
almost completely covered with thick underbrush making travel here rather
cumbersome.

At a Crossing of the Thon-Thalas River~
   A magnificent low slung bridge has been skillfully created from the marble
that is native to this part of Silvanesti.  Rather than quarrying blocks of
marble for use in this structure it appears as though the craftsman have carved
the bridge from the living rock itself.  Though the bridge is rather low, there
is still ample room for a raft or a canoe to pass underneath.  The bridge is
bordered on both sides by a polished marble railing which is home to several
torches which not only provide light but add to the natural beauty of the area
when their light is reflected in both the marble and the surface of the river.

Silvanesti Forest~
   The sky is almost completely hidden from view by the intricate interlacing
of leaves and branches.  The forest stretches out as far as the eye can see,
while in the distance the rushing waters of the Thon-Thalas can be heard.  
Plant-life thrives within the forest, offering homes to the woodland
inhabitants.  Tall trees stand like silent sentinels, keeping a vigilant watch
over the Silvanesti woods.
