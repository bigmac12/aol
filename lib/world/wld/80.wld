The City Gates of Istar~
   Standing before the massive gates to the city of Istar, a feeling of awe
fills your senses.  The fantastic architecture of the buildings is unsurpassed.
The gate itself is made of solid steel and a wire sculpture of the symbols of
Paladine and Mishakal have been placed on the right and left faces of the gate.
To the northwest, outcropping of large rocks form the shoreline of Lake Istar.

Along the Shores of Lake Istar~
   This roadway runs along the southern shore of Lake Istar from the gates to
the city's docks.  It is paved with blue and green blocks of stone that mirror
the colors of the lake.  A breakwater, appearing to be nearly a mile long, is
visible outside the main harbor area.  It serves to keep the waters calm and
peaceful.

magistrates of the city demand that each guard house be kept clean, but they do
not often come around during this busy time of year.  A few weapons racks adorn
each well.  They hold everything from short swords to pole arms.  There has not
been a real threat to the city in a long time, but the guards manage to fill
their time by bullying the common people.

way it is common for them to hand out alms to those less fortunate.  The view

The Walk of the Gods~
   Finely-fitted white stones make up the road known as the Walk of the Gods,
and tall lamps lean over the road, lighting the area brightly when night falls
upon Istar.  Here, the stones have been arranged to form the constallation of
Paladine, the Platinum Dragon, which is traced by a shining mixture of gold and
silver and platinum lines, bestowing a sense of absolute purity to all near it.

The Path to the Arena~
   The grey-stone path is surrounded on both sides by well-trimmed hedges
intertwined with rose bushes to add a splash of color.  Many people who are
eager to see the outcome of the next battle in the arena pass through this
area, or are returning from a show with smiles on their faces.  To the east the
path leads back towards the hub of the city, and to the northeast it leads into
the arena's entryway.

   The grey-stone path is surrounded on both sides by well-trimmed hedges
intertwined with rose bushes to add a splash of color.  Despite the small
amount of walking space, many people pass through, eager to see the next
battle.  The large arena peeks up over the top of the hedges, towering over the
area.  To the east, the path meets another road, and it continues toward the
arena to the west.

Standing Near the Seats~
   The arena contains row after row of benches, most occupied, for the comfort
of the spectators.  Some noblemen, many of which own gladiators that fight in
the arena, sit in padded, soft-backed seats closest to the action.  Unlike the
rest of the crowd, they refrain from cheering or applauding as the warriors
battle on.  The view of the center of the arena is not spectacular from these
seats, but it's good enough for the commoner.

   The walkway of the arena allows spectators to find a seat that pleases them
without disturbing anyone.  Running along the edge of the arena, it makes it
difficult to see the gladiators battling in the center pit.  The constant din
of cheering and applause is the main indication that the gladiators still
battle.

   The entrance is filled with people coming to and leaving from the arena.  
An arch as tall as four men put together, and wide enough to allow nearly all
of the crowd to walk through, welcomes you to the magnificent building.  
Shouts and cheers can be heard from the stands as a battle rages on in the
center of the arena.  A small stall has been set up to the south.

Dust covers the well-treaded ground, in some places marked by blood or the
imprint left by a clumsily-swung weapon.  At the sight of you, the crowd bursts
into applause, perhaps thinking a new battle is about to ensue.  It would be in
your best interests to leave post-haste before an armed gladiator gets the same
idea.

Underground Entrance to the Arena~
   This is the entrance used by the gladiators to enter and exit the arena.  
Filled with pieces of gaudy fake armor as well as dulled weapons and daggers
that retract when used, it also seems to be the place the gladiators prepare
for their "battles".  Several animal-hide bags, easily punctured with enough
force, are set against the wall, filled with the blood of the same creature
that provided the skin.  These are used to simulate the blood of a dying
warrior in the arena.  A hallway leads back into several chambers, where the
clamor of conversation and the muffled din of cheering from above intertwine.

The Mess Hall~
   Rows of long tables fill the mess hall, each fully packed with gladiator
slaves.  Loud voices boom over the sounds of normal conversation occasionally,
as well as bursts of laughter from groups of slaves.  Against the east wall, a
bustling kitchen works quickly to satisfy the hunger of the gladiators.  As
they line up with trays for a meal more nauseating than appetizing, a cook
slops it on their trays with a ladle.

Each has a cot to call his or her own, but without sheets or a pillow, and only
one blanket.  The few personal items each warrior has are stashed underneath.
A life of luxury certainly is not a gladiator's.

   This is the entrance that is used by the gladiator slaves to come in from
the city.  Normally used by recently purchased slaves, on occasion some veteran
gladiators are allowed to use it to leave the slave quarters when accompanied
by a guard.  The hatch leads into the ground by ladder, and is normally
guarded, making it difficult for a slave to escape.

room filled with warriors practicing for the arena.  On one side, racks of
dulled weapons lean against the walls, and warriors practice their ability to
thrust and parry, giving and receiving only a few scratches.  On the opposite
side, thick padded mats allow the gladiators to practice their kicks, throws,
and flashy moves that win the applause of the audience.

the southeastern corner of the room is covered by thick curtains, which must
surely be the bathroom area, added as an afterthought by the designer.  A door

just big enough to hold the book that rests on it.  Two of the four walls are
covered by bookcases full of literature from every genre imaginable, and a
third is dominated by a large fireplace, where a crackling fire blazes, keeping
the room well above warm.  A door to the north leads out of the sitting room.

A cozy rocking chair sits in the center of the room, with a basket of knitting
materials and a half-finished project.  A sturdy wooden desk with blank
parchment and a quill and ink laid out on its surface sits in the corner.  The
door to the north leads back into the hallway.

Before the Temple~
   The beginnings of the temple stand here in all their holy glory, the white
shining surface reaching to the heavens, revering the gods.  The beautiful
temple curves subtly at each corner with obvious care -- an indication of the
skill of the stonemasons that are creating it stone by stone.  Above an open
archway that may soon allow anyone that wishes to enter is the holy symbol of
each of the good gods of Krynn emblazoned in gold, a mark of reverence.  A
pathway lined with gardens travels south back toward the main portion of the
city.

A Small Grove of Trees~
   This grove is a common place for priests to ponder the questions of life
when they are not busy performing any duties.  The grove is very peaceful and
provides shade from the sun as well as an atmosphere.  Trees of every sort dot
the grove, and flowers grow close outside the grove so that they may not be
tramped upon.

Near a Small Bench~
   A bench has been provided here among the bushes and scattered trees, giving
rest to weary bones.  Priests often come here to read or simply admire the
temple as it is being built.  What will become the entrance to the holy place
lies to the west.

Just Inside the Temple~
   The large temple is truly splendid on the inside, representing the power and
glory of Istar.  The beautifully smooth white walls reach skyward, nearly four
stories high, stopping only to meet a white roof.  At the very top of the roof,
stone turns to glass, allowing sunlight to shine in upon the priests during the
day.  The floor is a beautiful white marble swirled with grey, stretching
without a crack across the entire temple.  Incredibly detailed, man-sized
paintings of past High Priests of Istar line the walls, further immortalizing
their legacies.

A Small Worship Area~
   This area is dedicated to the supreme god of goodness, Paladine, and
secondly to the goddess of healing, Mishakal.  Priests of the temple gather
here to pay homage to the gods, perform daily prayers, and seek strength in
times of hardship.  Both gods are depicted in two large statues of pure white
stone to represent their presense and protection over this area.

The Hall of Audience~
   The Hall of Audience is directly below the glass portion of the ceiling, so
that at noon every day, the dais to the north is bathed in sunlight.  On each
wall is a lightly padded bench where priests and nobles wait their turn to
speak with the High Priest.  A thick red carpet runs to the north up the the
stairs to the dais.  To the east is a small sitting room where the more noble
guests may wait, and meanwhile be entertained by some of the higher-ranking
priests to alleviate their boredom.  To the west is a small hallway that turns
to the north abruptly and heads to an unknown destination.

Atop the Central Dais~
   The dais is surrounded by a semicircle of extremely gradual stairs, the
center of which are carpeted all the way to the dais itself.  Atop it is a
small embroidered cushion to allow the Head Priest to sit without discomfort.
A strange light seems to eminate from the dais, filling all who look at it with
warmth and a sense of tranquility and a desire to humble themselves before a
force they cannot comprehend.  To the south, priests and lower-ranking nobles
wait patiently for the High Priest's audience.

A Small Sitting Room~
   Filled with many extravagantly-decorated chairs, all of extremely well make
and almost as comfortable as aesthetically pleasing, the sitting room is well
suited to high nobility.  Racks of books and holy texts, some hundreds of years
old, are there merely for their appearance, as are the large robust paintings
depicting holy scenes of times long past.  A small crystal chandellier hangs
from the ceiling, decorated with gold and silver, providing a soft light even
during the day.  There is a door to the west which leads into the Hall of
Audience.

A Short Hallway~
   Perhaps the only place simply decorated in the temple, the hallway extends
around a corner and to the north, where it ends at a set of double doors, and
to the Hall of Audience in the east.  Thick blue carpet rests on the white
tiles below it, and candleholders light the hall along the way.

A Guarded Area~
   This area is normally very heavily guarded, the only place where weapons are
allowed in the temple.  The hall here ends at a set of double doors with
long-handled golden knobs and the symbol of Paladine on each in silver.  The
area is well lit by several candle holders and is covered with a navy blue
carpet that makes for easy walking.  The hallway continues to the south.

The Personal Chambers of the Head Priest~
   The Head Priest's chambers are simply extravagant in their decoration.  The
high-ceilinged chamber is dominated by a magnificent four-post bed, each post
twisted with large bands of silver, and the symbol of the priesthood of Istar
is carved into the headboard, laiden with enough gold to buy an entire town.  
A perfectly-stitched blanket dating hundreds of years back lays over the rest
of the well-tailored sheets and plump pillows.  A gold-framed mirror rests
above a marble washbasin, and on another wall a painting as tall as two men
depicts the Head Priest in all his radiance.  A fireplace crackles loudly from
one corner, not giving off the slightest trace of smoke, and a personal altar
with a small statue of Paladine in the center has been built in another.  A set
of double doors to the south leads out of the room.

A Peaceful Grove~
   Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city of Istar, this grove offers peace
and serenity to all who rest here.  Surrounded by hedges, and filled with
shapely trees and well-trimmed grass, it lends a closeness with nature as well
as an order in a world of chaos.  Beneath one of the larger trees in the center
of the grove sits a pedastal with a delicately engraved plaque upon it.

A Dark, Winding Staircase~
   Winding down into the dark depths below, and running into a rough ceiling
above, the crumbling staircase is operable, if in disrepair.  From the thin
layer of dust piled on the ancient stone, it seems to have been many years
before anyone has set foot inside this chamber.

Karthan's Weapons~
   Inside the weapons shop, almost every sort of instrument of battle hangs
from or rests against one of the four walls.  Clubs and staves and other less
dangeous weapons sit on the west wall, while opposite to it rest spears,
javelins, and blades of the finest steel.  A fine selection of knives and
daggers sit on a sheet of velvet for display.  Behind the counter, far from the
customer's reach, a few rare weapons are balanced carefully on sturdy pegs.
