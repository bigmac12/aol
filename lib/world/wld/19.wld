The Palanthas Plaza~
   This is the center of the Palanthas Plaza.  All around you people conduct
their day to day business.  Many travelers and locals alike often come here to
socialize and discuss both business and personal matters.  Since this is the
main hub of the city most of the shop owners have purchased the property around
it so as to be conveniently located to their customers, but the high prices
they paid for the land and buildings have caused many of them to slightly
overcharge for their wares.

Wall St~
   Directly to the north, the city walls of Palanthas tower above the roadway.
Houses and shops line both sides of the street here but many of them look more
in need of repair then those in the better areas of the city.  Most of the
people who live here do so because their lives are tied to the docks and the
sea just to the north of the town.  A strong smell of the sea and rotting fish
permeates almost everything in this area.

The Northern Gate~
   This is the northern entrance to the city of Palanthas.  All the goods and
people who come to Palanthas by boat must enter this gate under the watchful
eyes of the Palanthas guards.  Most of the city, including the famous Central
Plaza lie to the south of this gate.  A strong smell of the sea is carried
along on the breeze blowing into the city from the docks to the north.

   Here the walls of Palanthas begin to curve from an east/west to a more
north/south direction.  Many old and decrepit houses line both sides of the
street but the further south you go the newer the houses become.  Obviously,
the rich have all moved to the southern side of the city leaving the poor to
endure the stench of the sea.

covered with a layer of dirt and grime.  Most of the buildings on either side
of you aren't exactly falling down but they are in need of some repairs.  Most
everyone who lives here does so either because it is close to the harbour or
the market.  A slight breeze from the north wanders it way southward into the
heart of the city.  A small grate has been set into one of the paving stones
here.

still carries a faint smell of the sea, but it is quickly being replaced by the

The Palanthas Plaza~
   This is the famous Palanthas Plaza.  All around you people conduct their day
to day business.  Many travelers and locals alike come here to socialise and
discuss both business and personal matters.  Since this is the main hub of the
city, most of the shop owners have purchased the property around it so as to be
conveniently located to their customers, but the high prices they paid for the
land and buildings have caused many of them to slightly overcharge for their
wares.

Avianath's Imported Clothing~
   It is like a clash of cultures in this shop.  There are many different
styles of clothing.  Ranging from light weight items from deserts to heavy
winter coats.  Each has its own style.  Being a port town, Palanthas gets many
imported goods, clothing is no exception.  The shop itself isn't anything too
special if you ignore the clothing, just a simple room with a couple windows
and a door.  The feel of this place is nice though, a relaxed setting, a few
small stalls for changing, and some seats.

Before the Elemental Inn~
   To the north lies the Elemental Inn, where a weary traveller may, for a
price, rent a room to rest in.  While the inn in days of yore was not the
cleanest place a traveller could hope to lay their head, new ownership has made
major renovations and re-established the Elemental Inn as one of Solamnia's
nicest inns.  Baltar, the Innkeeper makes a guarantee that if your room is not
to your liking, he will allow you to stay a second night for free.  Very few
travellers however, can find much reason to complain.

The Elemental Inn~

previous owner lost it in a game of cards.  The new owners have strived since
then to make it a more upscale, cleaner place for travellers to rest their
tired bones.  Several chairs and tables sit astride the central, raised aisle
which leads to the desk of the innkeeper, Baltar.  He sits, looking at you,
seemingly trying to judge whether you meet his high standards.  Behind him is a
row of locked cabinets in which he carefully stows his guests' belongings.  A
large fireplace is set into the eastern wall, warming the room.

that travel to Palanthas by sea must come across these piers.  The sounds of

   A stiff, cool breeze blows out of the north off the sea.  Around you sailors
wander into town looking for a bit of entertainment and merchants hurry by
checking on incoming shipments.  Many small boats are tied up here bobbing

The Beginning~
Please remember that you will be unable to level past level 10 until you
have completed your custom descriptions and have had them approved
by a staff member.  Also we require a written summary of each character
describing their history and personality.  Even a few simple sentences are
enough.  Please send these to @ageoflegends.com.

If you would like to start in Kalaman go West.

If you would like to start in Karthay go East.

Kalaman is usually where the majority of the players are.

The Palanthas Chamber of Commerce~
   The Chamber of Commerce was started by the businessmen of Palanthas to
further promote the city and attract more visitors.  The Chamber office is
bright and inviting.  Notices of all types line the walls: items for sale,
rooms for rent, and the like.  One sign that stands out from the rest is an
advertisement for the local tavern, The Elemental Inn.  A long counter stands
at the back of the room.

A Dark Alley~
   This dark alley allows those who know of it to take a short cut from main
street to either Penny Street or Wall Street.  Most of the people who use this
alley are of the more nefarious type and often use it more to hide in then as a
shortcut.  On both sides, the backs of the buildings that line the more
traveled roads soar into the sky overhead.

   This small dark room looks like it is the entrance way into a much larger
area.  All of the walls have been covered with a thick black cloth which seems
to absorb the sound of your voice.  These drapes move slightly with a draft
from some unseen location.  As you look around the room, you suddenly get the
impression that someone is watching you.

were in there this room was totally invisible.  Anyone inside the entrance
would have no idea that they were being observed from here.  The sound of
revelry and the smell of roasting meat comes from the west.

An Intersection Between the Two Hallways~
   This is the intersection of two hallways, one leading east towards the exit
of the guild, the other running north and south.  A large drawing covers the
western wall, next to the entrance of what appears to be a shop.  To the north
the smell of grilling meats and the sounds of revelry can be heard.  To the
south, all is quiet.

the walls and muffle all sounds.  A soft light floods this area from the north,
and carries the sounds of revelry with it.  Although the light does nothing to
really illuminate this area, it does cause shadows to leap and jump about.

The Shadows Respite~
   This is the main taproom of the Shadows Respite, the guilds tavern and
entertainment hall.  The room is filled with tables where guild members can
relax and have a drink after a heist or two.  Against the north wall lies an
expansive bar, behind it lies more varieties of drink than might be thought
imagineable.  A small grilling area lies behind the bar as well, and a fairly
basic fare is available for those that find themselves a bit peckish.  A thin
passageway to the right side of the bar leads northward, where guild members
needing accomodations will find a number of sleeping chambers.  The taproom
extends to the east and west, the west end being a bit noisy.  Cheering and
rabble-rousing can be heard from that direction occasionally.

white light.  The drapes that cover the walls have been pulled back here to
reveal doors made of a thick, black colored wood and reinforced with iron
straps.  To the east you can hear someone giving instructions on how to
dismantle various types of locks.

circle this room.  Each one has been meticulously taken apart to one degree or
another.  If anyone ever wanted to know how a lock worked or more particularly,
how to pick a lock, this would be the type of place they would go to learn.  
Above each workbench hangs a set of lock picks of varying types.  A desk sits
in the center of the room, with various writing tools set upon it.  Currently,
quite a few documents are scattered over its surface.

   This room is just large enough to accomodate one occupant comfortably, as

all made of dull grey stone and are bereft of decoration.  A small cot lies
against one wall, with a shabby looking nightstand set next to it.  A chest,
little more than a pine box really, lies at the foot of the cot for the
occupant of the room to store their belongings.  A torch set into a wall sconce
near the door provides the rooms only light.

   This is where those who buy and sell goods at wholesale prices come to do
their business.  A multitude of goods surrounds you.  Some vendors have set up
stalls while other have merely opened a case of their goods up for passersby to
look at.  The merchants here don't trade with individuals, instead they had
rather sell all their goods at one time to one or two merchants who own a shop
in town.  If you see something that catches your eye here, be sure to keep a
check on the shops in and around town over the next few days and you will
probably see it again.

The Emporium~

shelf variously shaped containers hold everything from basic spell components
to fully completed potions.  A massive table towards the back of the room is
covered in large books and several pieces of parchment.  The jars are
apparently extremely high quality but judging by the almost overpowering smells
that assault your nostrils, it is obvious that some of them are begining to
decay.

The Lord's Way~
   This road is little more then a wide and well kept alley.  The richer
citizens, lords and ladys of Palanthas decided to shorten their walk to
different areas of the city and took advantage of certain uninhabited areas to
do it.  By having some workers come through and clear out all the debris that
had accumulated around the buildings they were able to make this alley
passable.  Now, streetsweepers roam the area constantly trying to keep it clean
so as to be pleasing to the upperclasses delicate and sensitive noses.  Also,
flagstones have been laid down to keep them from having to walk on mere dirt as
they go about their business.  The buildings that line both sides of the alley
are also kept clean and in good repair so as to be more pleasing to the eye.

addind its own unique smell to the ocean of aroma that fills the area.  On one

yellow carnations and kudzu give the impression of yellow dots floating on a

   This immaculate garden has a multitude of flowers blooming in it, each one

   On each side of this foyer tall, slendar pillars support an ivory colored
arch made of stone with the lord's coat of arms carved on it.  Ivory colored
steps lead up to the double doors that are the entrance to the house.  A
fragrant aroma of flowers wafts its way from the west where the garden is.  
The doors to the east are massive.  They tower well over your head and have
thick iron bands decorated with gold and silver scroll work and each panel of
the door is a rich mahogany color.  Over top of the doors some words have been
carved into the stone.

and its shield.

past.  A thick red carpet covers the floor from wall to wall and here and there
a few well padded chairs allow those who wish to read a comfortable place to do
so.  This room is well lit to help eliminate strain on the readers eyes by a
multitude of candelabra clustered near each chair.  The smell of aged paper

Several chairs are scattered about the room, each with a small table beside of
it.  On top of each one of these tables is an ashtray made from fine crystal
inlaid with gold.  The chairs themselves are wide, very well padded and covered
with a high grade leather.  Several burns in the carpet shows where cigars and
pipe ashes have been dropped before.

   The entire eastern wall of this room is nothing but one large window.  
Various flowering plants have been set in front of it to catch the first rays
of dawn.  Most of these plants are seedlings, set here so that they can be
cared for and allowed to grow a bit before they are transplanted to the garden
outside.  On a small table to the north is a large jug used to water the
plants.  The smell of damp earth, potting soil and a slight bit of fertilizer
permeates the area.

dance and enjoy music when the Lord or his Lady hosts a ball.  Thick colorful
tiles on the floor compliment the oak wood paneling that covers the walls.  
Against the southern wall, a small stage has been build for musicians or other
entertainers to perform on.  Just to the east is the dining room where the
dancers can seek refreshment when they tire of dancing.

room comes from a large chandelier hanging directly over the table.  While it
illuminates the table it leaves the area around the walls of this room in
flickering shadow.

   Pots and pans of different sizes and shapes hang around the edges of this

oven large enough to roast an entire ox in dominates the southern wall, but at
this time its fires are banked and it is unused.  Against the eastern wall a
large tub sits on a table underneath a pipe coming down out of the ceiling.  
Apparently, the Lord has equiped his house with a gravity water system.  There
must be a cistern on top of the roof used to collect rain water and this pipe
runs down from it and can be used to fill the tub whenever water is needed.

comfortably on it.  Its sheets are made of a fine satin that feels like water
as you rub your hand over the top of it.  A dressing table and full length
mirror rest against the northern wall.  Here again the floor is covered with a
deep, rich, blue colored carpet.  To the east a set of glass double doors lead
out onto a balcony.

the cistern the water is over your head.

rather sell all their goods at one time to one or two merchants who own a shop
in town.  If you see something that catches your eye here, be sure to keep a
check on the shops in and around town over the next few days and you will
probably see it again.

wider than a single wagon.  The cobblestones still appear new and almost clean,
with little wear, and some still seem to wobble slightly, not yet having seen
enough travel to seat them firmly into the earth.  To the east is the port town
of Palanthas, a bustling hub of commerce and home to both the Great Library and

   This is a simple stone corridor, bereft of decoration.  It is quite narrow,
allowing for perhaps two people to walk abreast.  The corridor is very dark,
the only light comes from the bar to the south, and a torch somewhere in the
distance ahead.  Because of the stone and lack of light, it is rather cool
along this stretch of corridor, enough so to possibly chill those dressed less
conservatively.  A set of three oaken doors can be seen further northward in
the gloom.

Generally, these doors are left unlocked however, and on the other side lie
sleeping chambers for guild members needing accomodations.  The area is lit by
torches set into iron sconces on the walls.

little more than a pine box really, lies at the foot of the cot for the
occupant of the room to store their belongings.  A torch set into a wall sconce
near the door provides the rooms only light.

some of them in disrepair from constant use.  The stale smell of sweat lingers
in the entire room, though not unbearably so.  A rack bearing burgundy-colored
towels sits near the door, likely for combatants to wipe away the sweat of
their exertion, as well as possible blood.

Age of Legends~
   Welcome.  Now that you are here, we wanted to tell you a little bit about
Age of Legends and our philosophies.  We define ourselves as an RP-enforced
MUD, but what exactly do we mean by that?  We are a MUD.  As such there are
levels, skills, and equipment.  These things are of varying importance to
different players and characters alike.  They are nothing to be ashamed of, in
fact most people are quite proud of them.  We are not a MUSH.  Although
everyone has a personal life, it is just that personal.  When you step out into
the world of Krynn and into the realm of Age of Legends, you are putting on
your adventurers hat and going forth into a world of the unknown.  You are not
stepping onto a stage where you should reveal the most private aspects of your
character. Please be sure to visit our website at ageoflegends.planetmud.com.

mission~

Below is our Mission statement as Immortals here at Age of Legends.

Our world is a world of adventurers.  We seek to create an environment where
characters can embrace their wanderlust and explore our more than 8,000 rooms.
Sure, everyone has a home and a family, but our world is made up of those who,
for whatever reason, were driven to leave home and family behind and go out
into a world of new places/faces/and taverns.  It is this driving force that
makes them interesting and makes them who they are.    

A vital component of our Dragonlance world is ensuring that the players
properly assume their roles as a specific race or class. It is this patchwork
of individuals that drives our dynamic world. We, in our roles as immortals,
are here to offer information, examples and opportunities for players to
actively assume their roles and make our world the best it can be.  We are
also here to ensure that the guidelines and rules of the mud are followed in
order to provide for a level playing field.

Dragonlance~

   Dragonlance is a Campaign setting for Advance Dungeons and Dragons.  It is a
wondrous world of heroes and villains.  If you are not familiar with the world
of Krynn, take a look at the wealth of information that is available online.  
It is important to note that we are in a Pre-Cataclysm Dragonlance setting.  


   Visit our website at ageoflegends.planetmud.com for more information as
well as a Dragonlance timeline (in the Help Dragonlance section of the site).


   Type 'look laws' to view the Dragonlance Law of Consequence which 
contains important information for properly roleplaying your alignment.

law laws consequence~

The Law of Consquence - Each of the three alignments in the univers of Krynn
espouses its own philosophy.  These philosophies are the roots of all moral
action in the world of Krynn.  Please familiarize yourself with them so that
you will be able to accurately reflect your character's alignment.

1. Good Redeems its Own: Also known as the Law of Paladine, this statement
reflects the approach of all gods of Good in their efforts to advance the
truth and the knowledge in the universe at large.  Good seeks to forward its
goals and aims by redeeming and recalling the lost members of its flock and
bring about the advancement of the universe by compassion and justice.
2. Evil Feeds Upon Itself: Also known as the Law of the Dark Queen, this
reflects evil's belief in natural selection through the elimination of
weaker beings.  Chaotic Evil's objective in the universe is the supremacy
of might without any moral considerations whatsoever.  Lawful evil's are
similar, but it seeks to attain supremacy through the rigid application of
a morality of strength.

3. Both Good and Evil Must Exist in Contrast: This is known as the Law of
Gilean or the Doctrine of Shadow.  This is the primary position of the
Neutral gods who see the diversity of both view points as balancing one
another on a universal scale.  Should either side dominate, Neutrals maintain
the universe would be either light or dark without any contrasts to bring
focus or purpose.  Neutral's objective is unity in diversity.

4. The Law of Consequence: This final law was given by the High God himself
to rule over all other laws. For every law and rule that is obeyed there is
a reward and blessing; for every law transgressed there is a punishment.
Blessings and punishments may not come about immediately, but they occur
eventually.

Game Mechanics~
   Now that you know a little bit about us and our world, let's take a look at
some of the basic game mechanics.  First, there are a few commands that might
make reading your screen a bit easier: autoexit, display, and color.  
Additionally, if you are using telnet you may want to be sure that your 'Local
Echo' option is selected so that you can see what you type.  Even better, if
you can get a mud client, you will have a command line and can avoid the
scrolling problems of telnet.  You may also create aliases for repetitive
commands.    
   Type 'help autoexit', 'help display', 'help color', and 'help alias'.

Taking Care of Your Character~
   You want to be sure that you take care of your character so that all your
hard work does not go to waste.  Be sure to type 'save' from time to time to
save your character information.  Additionally, you will want to rent your
character at an inn.  This way all your belongings will be stored and saved for
when you come back.  You must have at least one night's rent on hand when you
go to the inn, but the rest can be drawn from your bank account.  When you are
adventuring be sure to carry food and a waterskin with you because you will
need to keep your character fed to keep your strength up.  Also, use the 'rest'
or 'sit' command to help your character make the most out of any downtime.  
This way they will recover movements and hitpoints faster.  Another key element
of character development is practicing skills. More on that later.
   Type 'help rent', 'help bank', and 'help practice' for more information.

Combat~
   Throughout the world you will encounter non-player characters (NPCs) which
are also commonly called mobs (mobiles).  At Age of Legends the killing of
these mobs is considered an out of character activity.  It is the primary way
that you will earn experience, and therefore, levels.  There is a mob in this
room for you to use for practice.  The best thing to do is to start by looking
at the mob.  So type 'look mob'.  Then you will probably want to consider the
mob.  So type 'con mob'.  This will help you to determine if it is a good idea
for you to attack.  The consider command only compares your level and that of
the mob, so things like equipment and weapons are not taken into account.  
Consider carefully before attacking.  A mob can kill your character.  If this
happens there is no need to consider your character dead, however you will lose
experience.  Additionally, you will need to return to the place of death to
retrieve your items and cash on hand.  Type 'help' for more information.

Spell Casters~
   At Age of Legends we have a memorization system (often called a mem system)
for our spell casting classes.  This replaces a numerical mana system for spell
casting with a system that involves a bit more thought.  Characters have a
certain number of spell slots that they can use to memorize the different
spells that they have already practiced.  Once a spell is memorized, it can be
cast.  Please remember that you cannot memorize a spell until you have
practiced it with a trainer.  Use the 'practice' command to see what spells you
have and your proficiency with each spell.    
   Type 'help mem' and 'help practice' for more information.

Fighting Classes~
   Unlike the spell casters, the fighting classes rely on their physical
prowess for advancement.  There are several different classes of fighters each
with different characteristics and skills.  As a character advances in level
they can expect to get new skills which they will need to practice.  To see
your list of skills and your proficiency with each, type 'practice'.  Included
in the fighting classes are warriors, dwarven defenders, and others.    
    Type 'help skill' and 'help practice' for more information.

Clerics and the Holy Order of the Stars~
   All clerics in the Dragonlance setting and here on Age of Legends are
actually priests and priestesses of a specific god or goddess.  The spells that
any priest may cast is a power that their god has granted them - hence, priests
of different gods and goddesses will have a different spell selection, which
depends mainly on their god's beliefs and standard duties.  The Holy Order of
the Stars refers to the three categories of clerics that serve the gods of this
universe.  These follow the lines of Good, Evil, or Neutrality.  Within these
three divisions are found the clerics and orders of each of the gods
individually.  Members of the Holy Order of the Stars enjoy the many privileges
bestowed upon them by their gods.  To maintain these blessings each cleric of
Krynn must walk the straight path as dictated by their deity.  It is true that
some paths are wider than others, but all gods agree that the penalties for not
following the precepts of one's religion are great indeed.

The Conclave of Mages~
   All mages draw their power from the moons of Krynn - Solinari, the White
Moon, Lunitari, the Red Moon, and Nuitari, the Black Moon.  Each of the three
gods of the moon oversees a particular alignment of mage - as a result of this,
a mage's spells, especially at high levels, will differ greatly depending on
that mage's alignment.  Magic-users can rise to the level of Initiate without
formally declaring their loyalty to the Conclave.  Thus a magic-user could
remain an Initiate all their life, practicing only minor spells, without having
to take the Test.  Those seeking greater power must take the Test of High
Sorcery.  They declare their alignment and are assigned to a higher level of
mage to serve time as apprentice wizards.  All mages on Age of Legends begin as
untested aspirants.  If you wish to become a member of the Conclave, you must
seek out a master and serve as an apprentice prior to your test.    
   For more information type 'look test'.

test~

   The Test is more than just a trial of a person's magical abilities it also
tests how that person will use the abilities he has and those he will gain.  
Each Initiate's test is different, designed especially for his needs and
weaknesses.  A wizard who agrees to take the Test pledges his live to the
magic.    

   Wizards who attempt to live outside the law of the Towers of Sorcery are
known as renegade wizards.  Renegade wizards are considered by all orders
to be a menace to the balance of magic in the world.  A renegade wizard who
has come to the attention of the orders is invariably seen as a threat that
must be neutralized or eliminated.

Druids~
   Druids are the protectors of nature, believing in the sanctity of the
natural world.  Although they worship gods of several faiths and alignments,
they all have a similar goal in the defense of nature.  Druids receive a wide
variety of spells from their patron god or goddess.  They may only use weapons
and armor made of natural materials, save for a select few items used in
ceremonies.  An effective druid will possess an above average wisdom and
charisma.

Monks~
   This class combines the best of the oriental combat techniques with some
thieving skills.  The rigors of the class require that the character be lawful,
but monks may be good or evil, or neutral in regard to good and evil.  Monks
are dedicated to achieving perfection in mind and spirit and body.  As such,
they lead simple and meditative lives.  This is reflected in their physical
appearance and clothing.  They are not permitted to wear armor of any kind.  
Instead they favor clothing that allows them to maximize the use of their
skills.  Likewise, they favor the use of their barehands over weapons in
combat.  They have excellent offensive skills but are not as strong in the
defensive area, favoring a quick and decisive attack.

Uncle Harkin's Quota~
   This strangely named shop belongs to the guild's fence, Harkin.  All manner
of items line the walls and shelves, from the cheap and common items, to the
rare and very expensive.  Everything is neatly arranged, and not a speck of
dust lies anywhere in the room.  A large counter lies against the west wall,
and Harkin himself can usually be found standing behind it, arranging this or
that.  A small scale rests on the counter, the counter-weight appearing to be
broken.

Knights of Solamnia~
   At this point in time the Knights of Solamnia are revered for their honor,
social standing, and service.  It could be argued that they represent the best
that Krynn has to offer, and as such are to be treated with respect.  They are
men and women who have sworn their life to uphold the ideals of honor and
chivalry, and who seek to promote the cause of good across Ansalon.  Here at
Age of Legends, characters who are interested in joining the Knighthood will
begin as squires.  They should actively seek out a sponsor knight and be ready
to prove their worth.

Paladins and the Blessings from Above~
   Paladins are holy warriors, those who embody both the values of warriors and
of clerics.  They believe strongly in the powers of the gods and the forces of
good; however, they, unlike clerics, are more prone to using brute force to
augment their spells, rather than relying on spells and the power of their gods
or goddesses alone.  Paladins are not a class that can be selected during our
creation process.  The only way to earn paladinship is to roleplay your
dedication to a god and to use the 'prayer' command to show demonstrate your
faith.  Paladins are lawful and believe in a strict code of honor.

Thieves and Rangers~
   Rangers are natural warriors, hunters, and trackers.  Most rangers dwell in
the forest, away from cities and their inhabitants.  Rangers possess keen
senses and have a great deal of insight and perception.  Their skills make them
adept at surviving in the wild, being able to hunt animals, track, fight, and
forage when needed.  Rangers do have some casting abilities, so be sure to
review information on our memorization system.  Rogues are masters of
deception.  They excel at moving about silently and concealing themselves in a
variety of ways from others.  They are also expert hunters, with a number of
abilities that allow them to follow their prey virtually anywhere.  Although
some rogues are light-hearted fellows who use their deceptive abilities for
pranks, many walk the darker paths of life and use their skills only to bring
about personal gain and the downfall of others.    
   Type 'help mem' for more information.

Choose a Starting City~
Please choose a city in which to begin your adventure by saying the name
of the city:

  Kalaman - A welcoming port town in the north.  Its citizens are generally
            good-hearted and law-abiding.
  Karthay - A northeastern town of excess and pleasure, often dangerous.
            The inhabitants are known to follow a somewhat... skewed moral code.

Both of these cities are suitable for your character.  Say either Kalaman or
Karthay and you will be transported to the appropriate city.

   Various bits and pieces of armor hang on the walls of this rough cut, wooden
building.  Off in the far corner several shields of differing sizes have been
arranged into a display.  A massive counter rests in the middle of the room
almost completely covered with a highly decorated set of armour whos owner
