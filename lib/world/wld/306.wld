A Well Maintain Pathway~
   The grassland stretches out towards the west and south, the ground cloaked
in a profusion of wildflowers and clover.  A fresh, well packed dirt path has
been created by a group of people traveling in that direction.  The distant
snow-capped mountains provide a beautiful panorama with the roofs of Sanction
contrasting to the north and east.  A unknown magical force is keeping
stragglers from traveling further up the path, however a few cloaked figures
seemly walk on through without any problems.

Tavern Lane~
   Newly constructed and hastily at that, this section of Tavern Lane is packed
with a pieces of this stone and that.  Makeshift housing, and crude tents have
been stationed up into little campments as refugees and others seeking a new
place to start have made their temporary home.  While not the best looking
section of town, it certainly has a beautiful view of the valley and rivers
below to the far north and northeast.

Bliss Alley~
   This seems to be a narrow alley that leads east and west.  The buildings on
either side tower over the alley which is the cause of its dark, shady nature.
Those who care for the city's upkeep, clearly have not given this a second
thought in its care.  The ground is without pavement or stones, and is subject
to the elements which tends to make it a mud hole.

The Sandy Bank of the River~
   The sun during the day makes the sand rather warm and pleasant to lay down
upon.  The wagon path trails up the low hill on the northwest, and it ends on a
small wooden dock where narrow boats can come up and down with trade goods.  A
few tall birch trees grow a bit back from the sandy bank, it can provide some
much needed shade.  This is a rather peaceful place to rest and enjoy ones'
day.  However at night, it could rather different.

Inside a Large Canvas Tent~
   The inside of this tent is very clean even though it has seen a lot of use
during it's owners stay here evident by the fact that the grass that once grew
here has been worn away to bare dirt.  A small bundle of blankets have been
neatly folded and placed against the back wall of the tent right beside a low
table which apparently also serves as a bed.

Inside a Large Canvas Tent~
   The interior of this tent is covered with half empty bottles and smells of
stale alcohol, urine and vomit.  Several articles of stained clothes cover the
ground looking as if their owner just removed them and tossed them onto the
ground.  A small cot in the center of the tent is covered by a pile of blankets
and it seems that most of the foul smell is coming from them along with a loud
snore.
