The Vingaard Mountains~
   A small dusty gravel path breaks off from the main trail here.  Barely
visible as it tracks between boulders and trees, the path is long disused.  
The remains of ancient ruts speak of the weights which must have been pulled
along this old roadway.  Overhead a lone hawk circles lazily in the
updrafts coming off the surrounding mountains.

A Dusty Gravel Path~
   A small winding path traces its way around jagged edges boulders and through
deep ravines.  The air here is crisp and dry, and the wind stirs up tiny eddies
of dust, reducing visibility at times.  Long disused, the path is strewn with
the debris of ages.  Progress is difficult as the path meanders uphill sharply.

west the land drops off sharply such that it is impossible to tell what lies
beyond.  Dusty dry air swirls around, stinging as it drives into exposed skin.

Along the Edge of the Quarry~
   You stand on the edge of a massive pit.  Once, long ago, this was a busy and
productive quarry, mining gravel from the pit as well as rocks and precious metals
from the mines, which lay far underground.  Now, it lies abandoned.
Gravel and small rocks cascade down the sides of the quarry as you walk along
the edge, the echos from their fall sounding strange and hollow in your ears.
Nothing moves as you scan around except strange eddies of dust as the wind
swirls around randomly.

   Walking along the northern edge of the quarry, you notice the dust swirling
in strange and not entirely random patterns.  The air coming off the mountains
is dry and cool, adding to the feeling that all is not well here.  Looking down
into the pit you notice where rock and sand slides have partially filled in the
quarry, making attempts to descend to the botton somewhat precarious.  The
walls of the quarry are steep and with the small rocks and gravel looking like
it wil give way any moment, it would be advisable to chose your route with
great care.

A Steep Descent to the Bottom~
   The way becomes more treacherous here as the decline increases dramatically.
Every step produces a small landslide of gravel and small rocks as they
tumble down the slope, their passing echoing strangely off the walls of the pit.
Small eddies of dust rise up from the ground, swirling about you eerily.  To

north the bottom of the pit rises up sharply.

   Stepping gingerly off the edge of the lip, you begin your descent down the steep

Near the Bottom of the Quarry~
   Your descent down to the bottom of the quarry is blocked by an immense
boulder.  It stands out oddly against the otherwise relatively plain landscape
here in the quarry.  Having uncovered it in the early days of the excavation,
the builders of this pit obviously found it to be too much effort to move or
break the rock, so they left it as it was.  Unfortunately, it is too lagre to
go over.  It is necessary to journey around this behemoth to reach the bottom.

Near the Bottom of the Quarry~
   The steepness of the face of the pit makes for hard traveling.  However, as
you get closer to the bottom of the quarry, details are easier to discern.  A
figure sits near some sort of opening in the ground, perhaps the entrance to
the mine.  Looking around, you begin to notice bits of equipment sticking out
at odd angles from the sides of the quarry, perhaps at one point in the past
there was a massive landslide.  In any case, bits of metals glint dangerously
in the light, making you choose your footing with care.

over with a sturdy iron grate so that no one falls into the elevator shaft.  
Peering into it, you see that it descends far into the depths.  Various cables
and pulleys dangle from the ceiling, likely being how how the lift is
propelled.  The miners used to use the elevator to get to the riches which once
lay far underground.  Although now lying abandoned, it still appears to be in
good shape.  Just off to the side of the elevator shaft is a lever.  This is
probably how the miners called the elevator up from the bottom of the mine.

blackness of the place is broken only by the faint light coming down from the
elevator shaft.  In the gloom at the edge of your vision you can make out small
shapes skittering across the ground, heading down one of the large cavernous
tunnels which branch off from this staging area.  A small lever is set into the

bottom of the quarry the air is cool and dry.  Various bits of old mining
equipment can be seen rusting, their purpose unknown.  A large depression can
be seen and within it, an immense iron grate.  Sitting next to the grate is an
old man.  He chuckles periodically as he whittles on a walking stick he is
constructing from a piece of oak.

elsewhere.  Flecked with bits of gold, this was probably an area where the
miners had found a vein of gold and had followed it.  Unlit torches can still
be seen in small niches carved from the walls of the cavern.  Strong wooden
cross beams remain where the miners shored up weak areas of the tunnel.

metal reflect light off the walls, creating strange flickering images for your
eyes.  This tunnel appears older than other areas of this mine.  It was
probably one of the first parts to be mined for it's ore.

of water flows down within, the sounds of its descent into the blackness can
be heard in the distance.  The beams holding up the cavern seem to be suffering
from the ravages of time as they creak loudly from time to time.

A Pool of Dark Black Water~
   A large pool of dark black water has gathered at the bottom of a small hole
which sinks into the cavern wall.  Water cascades down the hole,
splashing loudly into a pool below, the sounds of its passage unusually loud
against the strange quietness of the cavern.  Climbing back up the hole is
impossible, thus the only way to travel is to the southeast.

A Narrow Tunnel~
   The air here is moist, stale and damp.  Water drips from the ceiling, forming
tiny rivulets on the floor.  The water is stained red from pockets of iron ore
which lie hidden in the walls.  Tiny clusters of crystals glisten in the light,
inset within deep veins which run lengthwise along the wall.

A Narrow Tunnel~
   Small shards of twisted broken metal dot the floor of the passageway.  
Perhaps remnants of some ancient ore digging apparatus, their form is generally
unrecognizable now.  The small size of this passage tells you that the miners
obviously were following some narrow band of ore to its end.  The passage
widens ever so slightly to the north.  Dominating the area is a large crack in
the southern wall which leads further into the depths of the mine.

lies just ahead.  Peering into it you see nothing but darkness, however, a
faint hissing sound can be heard from far below.

The Bottom of the Opening~
   You stand in circular depression roughly twenty feet in diameter.  The floor
is covered with the bones and decaying corpses of various types of animals.  
Also, here and there, bits of armor and rusted swords can be seen.  The smell
emanating from this area is vile and putrescent, reeking of decay and death.  
Several low wide passages lead off from this cavern.

boulders lie strewn about, creating a maze within the tunnel itself.  Hundreds
of years of erosion and violent earthquakes have created an underground
labyrinth, which would have laid undiscovered had not the dwarven miners
accidentally stumbled upon it.  A noxious slime covers most everything here,
evidence of the passage of some sort of foul creature.

this place served as a storage area for ores of various types as they awaited
transport to the surface.  Now, it lays desolate and abandoned.

Before the Waterfall~
   The method by which this cavern was created is evident now.  You stand
before a one hundred foot waterfall.  The water pours out of a small opening one
hundred feet up the side of the cavern and crashes down to the cavern floor,
only to dissapear into a large fissure.  Mist blankets the area, soaking
everything near it.  A small tunnel can vaguely be seen from behind the
waterfall.

A Damp Passageway~
   Immense cobwebs hang limply from the walls and ceiling of the tunnel, stark
evidence of the lack of any recent activity in this area of the mine.  The
floor of the passageway slopes downwards sharply here, as the mine descends
farther into the earth.  The passageway twists and turns slightly as the miners
followed the vein of whatever substance they were mining.  The occational tool
lies on the ground rusting, having been long forgotten by its owner.  The
passageway branches here with a small tunnel heading south, and another,
seemingly well used, heading east.

The End of the Tunnel~
   The passageway is quite narrow here, sloping downwards and curving slightly
so as to prevent you from seeing what lies ahead.  Deep grooves have been
carved into the walls of the tunnel here, evidence that the minerals were not
easily extracted from this area of the mine.  The air here is hot and humid,
and water flows freely from cracks in the walls, forming large pools on the
floor.  The tunnel ends abruptly here, and an ancient, well used ladder can be
seen against the far wall, leading up to the tunnels above.

A Well Used Passageway~
   This passageway show signs of recent and continued use.  Fresh torches line
the walls, their light casting oblong shadows across the sides of the tunnel.  
The floor of the tunnel has been swept clean of all debris, including boulders
and rocks.  The walls of the tunnel are smooth, having been carved with great
care.  It is evident this passageway was never created for mining purposes.

An Antechamber~
   You stand in a spartan yet elequently decorated antechamber.  A few lavishly
colored tapestries line the walls, depicting scenes such as the Great Reorx
forging the world and the stars.  The walls of the room seem to glow with a
hint of red, as if the rock itself is alive with the spirit of Reorx.  A set of
sliding doors lie open to the south, leading to the main area of the temple.

The Temple of Reorx~
   You stand at the lower northern corner of a temple carved out of the living
rock by dwarven miners, so that they may pray to the great god Reorx.  Large
candles of red wax hang from the ceiling from thin steel chains, their light
giving the area a warm glow.  Pews carved from solid oak form a semi circle
around the obvious focal point of the temple, a raised dias, which lies a short
distance to the southwest.

The Temple Altar~
   You stand just before the altar, a massive dais carved from solid granite,
yet having a faint red tinge.  An aura of power and grace emanates from the
dais, sending a feeling of peace over you.  Atop the dais lie holy symbols and
other items of a priestly nature.  At either end stand two large steel
pedestals, atop which are enormous candles which illuminate the entire altar.

A Dark and Noxious Tunnel~
   Passage here is difficult due to the rubble which lies about.  Even the air
itself hinders movement as it is dense and foul smelling, stinging the lungs as
you breathe it.  Gobs of incandescent slime lie in small pools and steaming
liquid drips from the ceiling of the tunnel, stinging exposed areas of flesh.

A Dead End~
   The passageway comes to an end a short distance to the west.  This area of
the mine tunnel is ancient and has not been actively mined in ages.  The
ceiling here extends into the gloom, making it impossible to see the roof of
the chamber.  A large sign has been fastened on the near wall of the
passageway, but the words have long since faded into obscurity.  Oddly, a large
and thick chain can be seen descending from the darkness above.  What it does
and where it goes is impossible to determine.  It sways slightly, giving off a
faint aura.

darkness reveals a scattering of gold coins on the floor.  The sounds of your
passage echo hollowly off the walls of the cavern.

The Dragon's Lair~
   You have stumbled upon the lair of a great dragon.  Riches of all shapes and
sizes lie about the area, stacked into large piles.  Heaps of gold, steel, and
platinum coins are everywhere, and treasure chests as well as enormous
gemstones can be seen poking out from within the piles.  The scent of the
dragon is very strong, and from the size of the crimson scales on the floor, it
is a large one.
