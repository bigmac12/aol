Mountain Pass Road~
   The towering walls of the great city of Palanthas rise up from the
surrounding plains, an imposing presense indeed.  Known throughout the
continent as a stronghold of the Knights of Solamnia, the citizens and militia
will not tolerate the presence of evil wills within its walls.  The smell of
the sea reaches your nostrils as a faint breeze blows in fron the north.  The
occational sea-gull can be seen flying overhead, searching far inland for food.
A long winding road extends from the great gates of the city, crosses the small
plain which lies between Palanthas and the mountains, and begins it's ascent in
the famed Vingaard mountains.

Mountain Pass Road~
   The towering walls of the great city of Palanthas can be vaguely seen in
the distance to the north as you begin the descent down the mountain.  Several
guard towers protect the city.  However, it is well known that the High
Clerist's Tower, several days ride to the south, which provides the true
protection.  A long winding road departs from the city walls, winding its way
across grasslands before beginning to climb the Vingaard Mountains.

The Vingaard Mountains~
   You are on the rough mountain pass road that leads through the Vingaard
Mountains.  This high up, the winding path is covered in a dry rubble that
makes for loose footing and in some places a long drop for the unwitting
traveller.  However, the road is wide enough to allow two carts to travel
abreast, so the danger is relatively small.  To the north, the city of
Palanthas can be seen rising above the mountains, kept perfectly safe by the
rocky peaks surrounding it.

The Vingaard Mountains~
   The mountain pass road meanders through the craggy cliffs without any
forseeable destination, moving left or right as often as straight, dropping
down as much as climbing up.  All around the pass are the tall jutting peaks,
impossible to scale, and long cliff faces of the Vingaard Mountains.  Only the
hardy traveller can make the journey in good time.  Despite the difficulty of
the road, it is quite well-used, providing the only entrance into Palanthas.

The Kalaman Wagonyard and Stables~
   This large wooden building lies just outside the city of Kalaman, and is
utilized by the local Militia and citizens as a wagonyard and stables area.  
The common smells of a stableyard float through the air, horses, hay, and other
less pleasant scents.  Several wagons lie around the yard out front, closed up
and waiting for their owners to return.  The stables lie further in, roofed to
shelter the ponies and stallions which commonly occupy the various stalls.

   The mountain pass, at this low an elevation, proves to be no real challenge
to walk or ride upon.  The Vingaard Mountain range is smoothed here, and only
slightly sloped, gradually turning into a sparsely wooded plain in the distance
to the south.  However, looking in the opposite direction, where the city of
Palanthas lies, the mountain road looks quite daunting to travel, winding

   At the base of the Vingaard Mountain range, the mountain pass road offers
the only way into the city of Palanthas in the north.  Though quite mild here,
the slope looks almost dangerous further up the pass.  Loose rocks and boulders
are scattered about, mixing with the occasional hardy evergreen tree, the only
plant life capable of surviving amidst the otherwise barren rock.  As the

Weeds now grow where once corn was raised.  These weeds would probably overgrow
the road if it weren't for the constant traffic along it.  Six deep ruts run
along the course of the road giving evidence that three wagons really can ride
abreast on it.  You can now see, in the distance, the mighty fortress of the

Vingaard River Highway~
   The road here is wide enough that several carts could travel it abreast.  
It is also flat enought that the weakest walker can cover a fair bit of ground
before needing a rest.  Off in the distance, fields of grain cover the
landscape and the occasional grove of trees provides the only shelter and
concealment.

   This is the Vingaard River Highway.  A broad, flat road that follows the
Vingaard River.  As the river follows its wandering course so does the road,
but it basically runs east and west.  A few trees dot the landscape here and
there and underbrush grows right up to the side of the road.

   Following the river, the Vingaard River Highway is used by many farmers,
merchants, and travellers, connecting to many major roads to the east and west.
The river burbles in the background, bestowing a comforting feeling of peace on
those who look upon in.  The scenery is otherwise drab, with spots of trees and
small plants and the occasional farmhouse.

be faintly heard, but they both still follow the same course.  The road widens
perceptibly here, enough so that several people or a few carts could make use

River Crossroads~
   The large river splits into two smaller rivers near this highway.  To the
north is the smaller river, heading westwards, and the larger of the two turns
south.  The main river heads east, further away from civilization.  Two bridges
span the two smaller rivers - one connecting the two highways, and the other
leading into the forest to the north.

Vingaard Bridge~
   This bridge is wide enough, and stable enough, to support two wagons side by
side, instead of either one needing to wait for the other to cross.  Thick
support beams hold this bridge in place, along the riverside as well as in the
middle, where some people like to fish on occasion.  On either side of this
bridge is a wide road - Plains Highway, that leads across grassy plains to the
Kalaman, and Vingaard River Highway, which follows the river southwards.

leave few surprises to jump out from behind the trees, and is packed well from
years of caravans and boots travelling upon it.  The main road heads in the
general western and eastern directions, and to the distant south Dargaard

Plains Highway~
   Plains Highway, as this road is commonly called, is made of solid, hard
packed dirt, and is wide enough for even a merchant's caravan to travel upon
easily without worry of running over the numerous other travellers or
adventurers who use this road to go from city to city.  To the east lies the
city of Kalaman, where the High road ends.  To the south can be seen the
distant Dargaard Mountains, and westwards, where the road continues, lie
lightly forested hills.
