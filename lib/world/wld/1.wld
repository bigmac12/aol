A Small Trade Hut~
   This small tradepost was for the merchants who traveled this stretch of
highway, offering a place where they might stop to rest and trade wares before
continuing on their long journey.  It is rather rustic in its built, with thick
wooden fixtures and a large counter which the owner has proudly built.  On the
walls are all sorts of items, but seemly nothing much is for sale.
