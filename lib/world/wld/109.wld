The Base of the Western Watchtower~
   The walls meet here at the base of the western watchtower of Thelgaard Keep.
The tower is constructed from large, granite blocks, each one easily weighing a
ton or more.  Narrow slits in the tower's exterior face overlook the terrain
outside of the keep, enabling the knights here to defend the keep from outside
attack or invasion.  A wide, stone staircase leads upwards, towards the tower's
top, and the corridor between the walls continues to the north and south.

The Walls of Thelgaard Keep~
   The walkway between the walls continues north and south from here, lit by
torches placed into iron wall sconces and bracketed to the granite walls.  A
few narrow slits cut into the walls overlook the mountain range beyond the
keep, allowing Solamnic archers to fire onto any invading forces without
risking their own safety.  The walls themselves are built from a solid, grey
granite, each block weighing at least a ton.

The Walls of Thelgaard Keep~
   The walls of Thelgaard Keep rise high above on either side, protecting the
Keep's inner confines from attack.  The area between the two walls is kept
relatively clear of debris, and is lit by torches that are mounted to the walls
by iron sconces.  A few narrow openings in the wall look out over the road and
the mountains beyond the keep, allowing those defending it to fire projectile
weapons upon anyone outside the keeps walls.

The Walls of Thelgaard Keep~
   The inner and outer walls of this keep create a wide corridor that runs
their entire length.  Narrow slits cut into the grey faces of the exterior
walls overlook the mountains beyond the keep, and a few torches secured to the
walls by wrought-iron sconces illuminate the otherwise shadowy hallway.  The
walls themselves are built of a sturdy-looking grey granite, quarried from the
mountains beyond the walls, and they sparkle slightly in the dim light from the
traces of ores and minerals within.

A Wide, Clear Pass~
   High cliffs rise along both the eastern and western sides of the road,
greatly restricting passage through the areas not directly along the path of
the roadway.  The road itself, however, appears remarkably well-kept, being
paved with large blocks of granite and worn smooth over the centuries.  In
contrast to the rest of the surrounding mountains, this area bears a healthy
looking stand of pine trees which continue on to the south.

   The surrounding cliffs soar skyward along both the eastern and western sides
of the road, greatly restricting passage through the areas not directly along

foul weather.  The stand of healthy pine trees begins to thin here, giving way
to a few scraggly pines yet clinging to the cliffs in a vain attempt to survive
in this rocky soil and climate.

they all possess, these fellows are in fact proud members of the Knights of
Solamnia.

along this route.  As a result of this incident the smaller roads to the north
have seen much greater traffic both to and from the great keep that lies to the
south of here.

of the knights in this detachment.

strict north-south route through the mountains.  Towards the south, a massive
stone keep is visible, a white banner flying from its highest point.  The road
is clearly well-traveled, kept even and free of debris, and the stones are worm
from the passage of numerous warriors and their mounts over the centuries.

The Southern Entrance to Thelgaard~
   Smaller than the northern entrance to the keep, this immense archway is by
no means cramped, easily handling three large horses riding abreast.  A massive
iron portcullis hangs overhead, allowing this entrance to be quickly and
effectively sealed off should the keep come under attack.  A wide, cobblestone
path angles away to the southeast, while the archway leads into the interior of
Thelgaard Keep's towering outer walls.

the road appears well-maintained and cleaned.  This white cobblestone pathway
continues northwest to the keep itself, and to the east, where one can begin to

   The sound of activity is louder here, becoming consistant with the noises
commonly associated with any stables.  The neighing of horses and the shouted
commands of several stableboys can be made out from this distance, though any
true conversation is yet undescernable.  The stables themselves can be easily
seen, and appear quite large dispite the limited amount of space available on
the cliffside behind this face of the keep.

between the stables and the keep itself.  Several smaller areas have been

   The wide stairwell spirals upward to the heights of the tower, ocassionally
passing by alcoves from where the keep's archers may hold watch over the
exterior of the keep.  Dotting the outward facing walls are several narrow cuts
and slits, enabling the keep's defenders to fire projectile weapons down upon
invading armies from within the relative safety of the keep's massive walls.  
The walls themselves are cut from impossing grey granite and look capable of
repelling any assault.

quarry as the remainder of the keep, the dull, grey surface of the stones here
have been polished smooth and the halls are lit by several sconces and
lanterns.  The corridor continues south, farther into the keep, while a stout

heart of the innermost walls.  It is rather squat when compared to the outer
towers, yet the lack of height only lends this tower a more formidible
appearance.  Formed of the same, massive grey granite that comprises the rest
of the keep, this tower is indeed impressive.  Wide, polished stone stairs lead
upwards to the tower's heights, and the hallway continues to the north and
south.

of knights and troops.  Here, in the keep's central barracks, is where most of
the keep's knights and troops make their homes.  The walls here are still
comprised of the same granite that dominates the keep elsewhere, yet there have
been many attempts to soften the harsh appearance of the barracks themselves.
Their are several tapestries of family crests and many of the walls are graced
with warm-toned wood inlays that serve a dual purpose as shelving and storage.
Several large wooden bunks fill this room, arrayed into perfect rows and
columns, allowing for order and cleanliness to be well-maintained.

Entering the Keep's Barracks~
   Located behind the central tower, this chamber allows for access to the
keep's twin barracks.  Once, when the keep was first formed, one set of
barracks had been reserved for the knights, while one had been specifically for
the housing of the keep's footsoldiers and archers.  Since that time the
barracks have been combined in a continuing effort to unify the whole of the
Solamnic forces stationed here.

   Here in the far side of the western barracks lies a small room, enclosed
from the rest of the larger chamber.  Within this small office the space is
minimal, feeling somewhat cramped and closed, yet nonetheless still very
organized and well-kept.  Upon a sturdy oaken desk lies a large, leather bound
book, it pages filled with small, precise handwriting.  As people come and go
from the office, a man rises from the chair behind the desk to greet them or to
wish them speed upon their journey, depending upon their respective intentions.

post is easily six inches thick and looks capable of standing against even the
most unrelenting assault.  Various manner of arms and armor can be detected
along the south wall, kept under lock and key, but readily available should the
need arise.  Several members of the garrison, as well as a few of the knights
themselves, mill about this area, always on the ready should their assistance
be required.  A large tapestry bearing the crest of the knighthood hangs along
a large portion of the western wall, appearing to fill the occupants with a

archways are small, polished bronze plaques, lending direction by offering up
the name of the rooms beyond.  Each of the archways are framed with heavy,
embroidered fabric that may be closed and tied to act as a divider from the
this, the outer chamber.  Softly spoken words can be faintly overheard from the
north, west, and east passages, while the passage to the south lies quiet, with
the drape pulled and secured.

has been layered over by an thick, exquisitely embroidered throw dipicting a
majestic, platinum-scaled dragon.  Only a small portion of the floor, along the
rear wall, has been left uncovered, where the floors are used to store the
footwear and other travelling garments of the entering worshipers.

skyward as though to seek their master in the heavens.  The room has a certain
stillness to it, despite the open windows that allow a wonderful view of the
surrounding area, as if even the elements surrounding the keep give respect to
this room.  A older priest stands at the altar, smiling gently out at the pews,
speaking the words of truth, order and goodness, speaking the word of Paladine.

the open windows that allow a wonderous view of the surrounding area, as if
even the elements themselves pay respect to the purpose of this room.  Behind
the altar stand a middle-aged priest, gesturing frequently and animatedly as he

warriors blessed in His eyes.

been masterfully sculpted to represent a pheonix rising, it's proud, majestic
wings spread, as if taking flight.  Unlike the other two clerical chambers,
this room is alive with the sounds of animal life, almost as if every sound
from the surrounding area has been somehow diverted here.  Underneath the other
noises, barely discernable, is what can only be described as the sounds of
waves crashing against the shore.  Behind the altar stands a younger man,
basking in the sounds of this chamber, relishing in the gifts of Habbakuk,
patron of animal life and the sea.

   An immense vallenwood table fills the majority of this chamber, it's large
circular surface surrounded by at least twenty or more matching, high backed
chairs.  A thick, velvet cloth dyed to a deep, royal purple has been carefully
thrown over the surface of the table to help protect it from harm, and the
chairs, while not opulent, are seated with plush, matching velvet cushions.  
Used for the conviening of Knighly Circles, this hall is a meeting place for
the high knights of the Orders to discuss current events and recount the deeds
of the Knighthood, as well as to plan for the future welfare of the Orders and,
indeed, all of Solamnia.

The Path of Honor~
   This chamber is far more cramped than the council chambers before it, being
lined with chests and many massive shelves.  Even then, the immense wooden
shelves are almost filled to overflowing with volume after volume of thick,
leather bound texts.  Within this chamber lies, perhaps, the most comprehensive
collection of recounted deeds of the Orders of the Solamnic Knights, including
the whole of the Oath and Measure and several additional texts on the meaning
of honor and proper behavior of knightly orders.  The chests also contain
similar scripts, all neatly bound and sealed within protective scroll sheaths.
To the rear of this chamber is a wooden ladder leading up to a small,
attic-like space, likely containing even more of the history of the proud
Orders.

A Small, Cramped Chamber~
   This small chamber rests at the top of the central tower of Thelgaard Keep,
perched high above the surrounding structures.  While intended to serve as
another of the keep's wacthtowers, the excess of materials from the room below
has encroached upon it's usefulness in that regard.  Several large chests,
overflowing with documents and various texts, now reside within this small
room.  Such a large amount of materials has the effect of making the room feel
quite cramped and rather claustrophobic.  To add to this effect, several of the
slits used for viewing the exterior regions of the keep have been blocked with
thick, wooden plugs to prevent the elements from damaging any of the many texts
stored within.

   This immense chamber contains row upon row of supplies needed for the
everyday operations of the keep.  Every manner of material can likely be found
here, from food stuffs to bolts of cloth, stones and grinding wheels to sheaves
of parchment and ink by the gallons.  From the amount of supplies and goods

   Turning south, the well-lit corridor widens even further and signs of
activity are much more predominant.  Several stern faced guards line the walls
here, backs straight, eyes constantly in motion for any signs of trouble.  
Wall sconces and lanterns become even more prevelent than before, making the
glaring light of this hall almost irritating to the eyes.  The knights standing
guard in this area look over all who pass through these halls very closely, as
though committing each face to memory.

A Massive Doubledoor~
   Here, in the south face of the thick granite walls, are a set of massive
doubledoors, sealed with an intricate and complex-looking locking device.  The
doors appear to be made of solid steel and, by testing the sound of them,
appear to be quite thick, as well, able to stand against any attempt to force
entry.  Etched into the face of each door is a phrase, written in the tongue of
the Solamnic Knights and barely discernable to the untrained eye.

   Only a short piece is yet recognizable from the phrase adorning the surface

re-tooled.  The phrase yet remaining roughly translates to "..  Words....  
Knights speak....  Path to Honor".

The Coffers of Thelgaard Keep~
   This cavernous chamber is vast and contains the funds raised to support the
Orders and to ensure Thelgaard is kept well-stocked.  Piles of coins of all
donations are neatly stacked and accounted for, and while the amount available
is staggering, the room is far from reaching capacity, obviously still somewhat
drained from the efforts of the last, great Dragonwar and the renewal and
rebuilding that followed.  Looking about the room, several of the valuables
contained within these walls are slated for various causes to aid the populace
in general including funds to the clergy, alms to the poor, and monies to help
in rebuilding many of the towns struck hard from warfare and other disasters.

Before A Large, Barred Gate~
   The corridor is abruptly cut off here by a sturdy, wrought-iron gate, barred
and locked to prevent further passage.  The gate itself is sealed by long,
heavy chains, easily wider than a finger's thickness in girth and wrapped about
the bars several times.  The lock which holds these thick chains together is
itself rather simple in design, yet still appearing quite strong and resistant
to damage.  On the opposite side of the gate the corridor turns to the south,
quickly becoming lost to the available field of vision.

The Armory of Thelgaard Keep~
   Every manner of weapon can be found here within the massive and well-stocked
armory of Thelgaard Keep.  Blades of every design line the walls, great
polearms stand in ordered racks, massive war-axes, stout maces and sturdy
staves, all well-catagorized and confined under lock and key.  Racks upon racks
of every form and piece of armor suitable for the knights and their garrison
can be found here.  To the rear, quarrels and quarrels of arrows and bolts are
bound and stacked together along side spare strings and other repair items.  
In a small clearing along the left wall rests a large grinding wheel and
serveral stones used for keeping the weapons in pristine order despite rigorous
use.

Along the Road to Thelgaard Keep~
   The road winds its way between the main road to the north of here, and a
large stone fortress to the south.  High cliffs rise along both the eastern and
western sides of the road, restricting passage through the area to the road
itself.  The road is well-kept, paved with large granite blocks and worn
somewhat over the centuries to a smooth surface.

The Road to Thelgaard Keep~
   Sheer cliffs rise up on either side of the road, forcing travellers along a
strict north-south route through the mountains.  Towards the south, a massive
stone keep is visible, a white banner flying from its highest point.  The road
is clearly well-traveled, kept even and free of debris, and the stones are worm
from the passage of numerous warriors and their mounts over the centuries.

Thelgaard Road~
   The road makes its way between the main road and Thelgaard Keep, a
stronghold of the Solamnic Knights.  Even from this distance, the white banner
bearing the kingfisher and the rose can be seen flying high above the keep,
calling attention to the strength and the pride of the Knights of Solamnia.  
The mountains to the west have given way to a more open plain, allowing the
Knights of the Keep pass to and from the keep with ease.

   This close to Thelgaard Keep, the narrow slits for arrows cut into the
exterior walls are readily visible, where archers and crossbowmen can fire from
safesty of the keep at any along the road's length.  The road is wide and
well-paved, constructed of numerous granite blocks set into the dirt and worn
over the passage of time.  Surmounting the keep, you can barely make out a
large, white banner, flying proudly over the keep.

Crossing the Drawbridge~
   The road ends abruptly here at the edge of a vast chasm, crossed by means of
an iron and wooden drawbridge.  The drawbridge is connected to the keep by a
series of massive iron chains, each one easily as thick as a man's arm.  The
chasm drops off sharply on either side of the drawbridge, its bottom obscured
by darkness and shadow, giving you a disquieting sense of just how deep it must
be.  A large wooden wheel on the keep's side of the drawbridge connects the
iron chains and supports to the keep and portcullis on the opposite side of the
drawbridge, allowing the Knights who reside here to raise and lower the
drawbridge at will.

The Portcullis of Thelgaard Keep~
   A solid iron portcullis marks the entrance to Thelgaard Keep, a towering
fortress of the Solamnic Knights.  The keep dominates the landscape, its
granite walls solid and as timeless as the mountains themselves.  A well-tended
road leads from the keep's entrance and down the mountains, sheer cliffs rising
on either side of the road and protecting the keep from attack.  A deep chasm
surrounds the keep, a drawbridge just to the north of here the only means of
passage across its depths.  The only entrance into the keep itself is by means
of the massive iron portcullis, allowing the keep a tremendous strategic and
defensive advantage to any foolish enough to try and attack.
