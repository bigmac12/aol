   The wide road here travels in a western-eastern direction, somewhat sloping
downhill as it heads east, and appears more barren, yet more rocky, than the
Dragonscale Highway.  A few trees scattered around here can still be called
forest, yet the atmosphere screams for want of being called barbaric.  This
road also appears to have aged more somehow.

   The road heads more or less in a northwest-southeast direction, sloping down
to the southeast.  The aging road is rather rocky and flanked by trees that
thicken farther to the southeast.  The forest has a rather exotic feel, with
large, leafy trees, likely centuries old.  There are a few ferns in the
undergrowth, and the entire area is cast in at least partial shadow, even at
high noon.

   The forest grows thicker all around you.  Combined with the heat, the
moisture from the forest creates a fairly oppressive amount of humidity.  The
air is positively alive with the sounds of forest creatures all around.  The

   The forest is particularly thick here, covering almost completely over the
battered road.  The sheer size and number of the trees here make it difficult
to tell whether it is day or night out.  Animals fall silent at your approach,
but the slightest winds cause the trees to sway, and the chorus of nature to
start up over again.  The road is almost lost in undergrowth, but can be seen
to continue in a rough, eastern-western direction.

   A particularly large tree has fallen across the road here, but can be moved
over or around without too much difficulty.  The stump of the tree shows one
that it has been cut down purposefully, though the way it fell indicates
incompetence on the part of whoever it was who cut it down.  The forest starts
to thin out a bit, and the sky can once again be seen.  The road is not as

Some smoke from the northeast indicates some form of settlement.  A few birds
fly overhead, and there are a few small mammals that can be heard chittering
from within the trees.  The highway turns off to the south, and to the
northeast, a path leading off the highway is barely perceptible.

   Topping a rise, one can see all around from here.  To the north a little
ways can be seen a small outpost.  Far, far off to the east, one can see a
distant city.  To the southwest lies the most breathtaking view however.  
Looking down past a few trees and rolling grass, a small path winds its way
downwards toward a clear, blue lake.  This part of the world seems almost
completely untouched by the hand of civilization, and its pastoral beauty is
truly awe-inspiring.

   A beautiful scene lays itself out before you here upon the shores of
Mystvale Lake.  The cool waters lap against the shore, composed of sand and
small pebbles.  The clear blue waters are stirred by a slight breeze, creating
small rippling waves.  In the early morning, a transparent mist covers the
waters, which disappears by noon.  Those who wish to see Mystvale lake at its
most scenic know to come here in the morning, when the mist sits over the
waters, and the warm light of morning's dawn bathes the entire area in a
cleansing light.

road to the east, something can be seen, though whether structures or simply
debris one cannot readily tell.  It does, however, offer some distraction along
Beyond this lies some kind of the otherwise barren highway.  A short jog to the

terrain seems to indicate that they make a fair usage of their land.

   This portion of the road shows signs of improvement, with large potholes
being filled in by sand and gravel.  It is still not an easy road by any means,
but better than it must have been.  It continues roughly in a north-south
direction.  To the south, a ways in the distance, the city of Lacynes can be
seen, smoke coming from its buildings and announcing its presence to the
surrounding countryside.

   The road is clear, and in a moderate condition of repair here.  Some of the
gaps have been filled in, indicating that at least a few repairs have been
done.  This comes as little relief to the travellers who have gone over the
roads to the west, which have for the most part been left to the devices of
nature.  The highway shows some signs of travel, and evidence that repairs are
warranted.  A carriage with a broken wheel sits off to the east.

   A short ways to the south sits the city of Lacynes, a fairly large minotaur
settlement, which lies isolated from most of the world.  The roads don't seem
to be a high priority, looking to have been built some time ago, but left to
disintegrate in the elements.  The minotaurs clearly have found better uses for
their money, and don't often receive many visitors.

   To the immediate west are crossroads atop a wide hill, leading in three
directions.  This highway continues in an eastern direction, sloping gently
wider than the other highways in this region.  The surrounding land appears
quite fertile.  The trees growing here are sturdy and rough - like the land
itself.

to the will of nature, following the gentle slopes of the hills rather than
cutting through them as it goes in a western-eastern direction.

   A monstrous tree which, from its massive size, appears to be part of the
vallenwood family has fallen across the roadway blocking passage.  A mass of

side of the highway, and it is now possible to continue along the highway.

   Song and laughter drift from a merry crowd gathered around a small cart with
a makeshift stage set up in front of it.  Men juggle, and eat fire as a small
comic play about Paladine is performed on the stage.  The sounds of nature are
drowned out by the merry sound of the gathered crowd, and by the look of coins
on the stage, it seems the travelling troupe is making out quite well.

   As it winds its way through the hillside, this stretch of highway is rather
difficult to pass.  It stands in sharp contrast to the wide, even sections of
the highway that travel through the fields.  Although the woods have thinned
considerably, many ancient trees stand along the side of the pass, stretching
their limbs toward the heavens.

ever-present storm hanging over it.  This portion of the road is rather tidy,
as many of the carriage and foot-prints seem to avoid travelling upon it, going
off-road a little to the north.  There is a sign upon the side of the road,
upon which is written a single, forboding message: "BEWARE".

tracks seem to veer off to the side a little.  A short distance to the
southeast, dark clouds hang in the sky at all times over a distant building.  
An odd sense of dread seems to fill those who travel along this portion of the
road which heads in a northeast-southwest direction.

difficult to pass.  It stands in sharp contrast to the wide, even sections of
the highway that travel through the fields.  Although the woods have thinned
considerably, many ancient trees stand along the side of the pass, stretching
their limbs toward the heavens.

   This portion of the highway is very firmly packed and quite heavily
travelled.  A few faint hoof marks and some shallow wagon ruts mar its
otherwise perfect surface.  The trees along the hillside thin somewhat this
close to the shoreline.  The briny smell of the ocean fills the air as a warm
breeze blows in from the east.  What appear to be city walls are visible
through the trees to the north and northeast.

   Better maintained, and appearantly more heavily travelled, then the majority
of the highway.  The lower branches of the trees have been cleared back from
the road to allow for easy passage of the many merchant caravans that pass.  I
light sea breeze blows in from the east, providing refreshment for weary
travellers having just passed through the hillside.

   Standing immediately to the north are the massive gates of the minotaur city
of Lacynes.  The city wall supplements the city's natural defenses, the ocean
to the east and the mountains the west, making the city and impenetrable
fortress.  All visitors, whether arriving by land or sea must pass through the
city gates or stop by the custom's house.
