A narrow passage~
   The passage is a bit wider but not much.  The feeling of being trapped and
dying is not discouraged by what look like bloody claw marks on the wall.  
Only to realize that the marks outline hand holds.

A tight narrow passage~
   The passage is tight and narrow.  The only way to wiggle through here is to
hold your breath.  The feeling of getting stuck here forever is unpleasnt at
best.

A narrow opening~
   What appears to be a small gap in the cliff face is actually a very narrow
crevasse.  Working carefully and slowly one might just be able to wiggle
through it.
