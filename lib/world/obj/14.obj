table bed~
   This low table serves many uses apparently.  It is barely long enough for a
person to lay on and is low enough to the ground that should that person roll
off its narrow width they would not fall so far as to suffer an injury.  When
cleared of blankets, its top can be used as a writing surface and while in
transit its owner can use its many drawers to make it into a kind of chest.

   Vinus Solamnus, the commander of the Ergothian Emperor's Palace Guard, set
forth from the capital city of Daltigoth to quell a rebellion brewing in the
northern reaches of the empire.  After the bloody but victorious march to the
heart of the uprising, Vingaard Keep, Commander Solamnus met with the head of
the rebellion, the nobleman in command of Vingaard, Antonias.  Antonias struck
upon something long lost in Solamnus, something great from his youth that he
had forgotten, his honor.  Finding that the claims to rebellion were justified,
Solamnus now sought some way to resolve the issue.  While all knew that it was
too late for Antonias to repent in the eyes of the despot Emperor Emann of
Ergoth, Antonias and Solamnus made a solemn oath that Vinus would take up the
peoples' cause.  Even while Antonias willingly gave his life to appease the
Emperor, Solamnus was gathering his troops together to present his case and ask
for their aid.  During this, Solamnus addressed the bulk of his troops, not
merely his advisors, and beseeched them to join him in his defense of the
peoples of Ergoth and their rights.  Any knight, any soldier, under his command
that believed in the cause of the rebels was entreated to stay.  Those who did
not were given leave to return to Daltigoth, unharmed by Solamnus or any under
his command.  Even though his men knew that doing so would mean exile and quite
possibly death, most chose to stay with Solamnus and take up the just and
honorable cause.

   Thus began the War of Ice Tears.  Although Ergoth was in the grip of the
most terrible winter ever chronicled, Solamnus and his dedicated army of
knights and frontier nobles marched on Daltigoth and laid siege to it.  
Solamnus personally led many of the daring raids into the city.  Within two
months time the capital fell as a revolt by the people of the city itself
forced the emperor to sue for peace.  As a result, the northeastern plains of
Ergoth, from the Vingaard Mountains to Estwilde, gained its independence.  The
grateful people of that region chose Vinas as their king and named their new
country Solamnia in his honor.  Although it never gained great power during the
remainder of the Age of Dreams, Solamnia became synonymous with honesty,
integrity, and fierce determination.  Vinas was a wise man and having seen
firsthand how seductive power could be knew that those who followed him as
rulers of Solamnia might not be as honorable as he.  Thus he organized an order
true to honor and justice, he organized the Knights of Solamnia.  The tale of
the origins of the Knighthood is bound up in the Quest of Honor that tells of
Vinas Solamnus's journey in search of true honor.  Following his coronation as
king, Vinas was beseeched by the Lords of the Northern Reaches.  They had
recently broken from the tyranny of Ergoth and now turned to Solamnus to unite
them.  Solamnus could not forsee how this could be done in the light of their
conflicting ideals and customs.  So it was that he set off upon a quest to find
an answer to this dilemma, he left the united kingdoms in the hands of his
lieutenants and journeyed forth into the wilds.

   After many weeks of searching and trial, he came at last to Sancrist Isle.
There in that wild place he found a glade and offered supplication to the gods
upon a black granite stone in the center of the clearing.  Three of the gods of
light came to him then: Paladine, the Father of Good, god of balance, justice,
and defense; Kiri-Jolith, the Great Bison, the god of just warefare; and
Habbakuk, the Blue Phoenix, god of good nature, loyalty, and the elements.  In
that glade did they outline for Vinas the model of a Knighthood that would last
thoughout the centuries.  Three seperate Orders would balance one another with
high ideals, each patterened after the ideals of the gods who came to visit
Vinas that day.  The Order of the Crown, dedicated to Habbakuk, would become
the epitome of Loyalty and Obedience to a rightous cause.  The Order of the
Sword, sworn to Kiri-Jolith, were to be the bringers of Courage and Heroism to
the rightous battle.  Lastly, the Order of the Rose, pledged to Paladine, were
to exemplify honor guided by Wisdom and Justice.  As a final blessing, the gods
transformed the stone before Solamnus into a pillar of translucent white
crystal.  This action sanctified the glade and sealed the unity of these three
gods in their commitment to uphold the Knighthood so long as the knights walked
in honor and worthiness.

   Two other legends relating to Solamnia and the Knights from the time of the
Age of Dreams stand out in the text.  The first tells of Bedal Brightblade, a
hero who was said to have fought the desert nomads to a standstill, holding a
pass into Solamnia single-handedly until help arrived.  His sword, Brightblade,
was said to be of dwarven make and never rusted or dulled.  His tomb is located
somewhere in the far southern mountains in an unknow location, and it is
rumored that in times of great need Bedal will return to aid Solamnia.  The
second tale is more recent, telling the tale of Huma Dragonbane, known as the
most perfect of knights.  Huma's legend, being a masterwork of the great elven
bard, Quevalen Soth, is much more well known and tells of Huma gathering
together a great group of heroes to destroy the dragons and drive them from
Krynn.  The story of the last battle betweem Huma and the Queen of Darkness is
epic and oft told, along with the tragic love that Huma bore for a silver
dragon.  Huma managed to drive the Queen back to the Abyss with the silver
dragon's help, but in doing so, sustained a gravely mortal wound.  The accounts
of Huma's final moments in this world are clouded and, even now, somewhat
fragmented.  Some account claim that Huma died that day, on the field of battle
after vanquishing the Dark Queen.  Others make claim that he lingered on for
days in such intense agony that the gods themselves suffered in sympathy,
inflicting terrible thunderstorms on the lands.  To this day, one may find
people that claim that lightning and thunder strike the land in memory of
Huma's pain.  Although never attaining high rank or station, Huma was buried
with great reverence in a tomb shaped to resemble his love, the silver dragon.
Before joining the Knighthood, tis said that many young squires often make the
pilgrimage to his grave to pay homage to the sacrifice of this great knight and
the ideals of the Orders he championed.
