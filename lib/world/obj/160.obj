medallion guild flowing flame red steel shape~
   Upon the face of this object is a raised flame engraving, set on a circular
medallion master-crafted from the highest quality steel you have ever laid eyes
on.  The metal feels warm to the touch and the engraving set in the steel
itself looks very much alive as the light refracts through the miniature
crystalline flame.
