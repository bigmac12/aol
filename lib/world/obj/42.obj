shield blackened steel large~
   This is a fairly standard shield of the kind used by infantry and footmen.
It is constructed of thick steel, and this makes it fairly heavy.  Only someone
of considerable strength could hope to use this shield to good effect.  Oddly,
it appears as though this shield has endured the flame, as it is completely
blackened.  This has the effect of giving the shield an iridescent look, when
the light touches it just so.
