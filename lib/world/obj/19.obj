shirt black silver~
   This fine velvet shirt is made of velvet, black as midnight save for the
beautiful silver embroidery down the front and on the cuffs.  Looking at the
pattern of the embroidery reveals a strange pattern, one that all but eludes
you as you ponder its meaning.  It is finely stitched, and looks quite
expensive.  A nice bit of finery.

   A broad-bladed dagger, the Katar is mainly unique because of its grip.  
Rather than featuring a traditional hilt, the grip of the katar is composed of
two parallel bars back in the same plane as the blade's edge, parallel to the
user's wrist and forearm.  These two bars are connected by a handle, which the
user wraps his fist around.  When attacking the wielder makes a punching
motion, driving the blade into his opponent.  This has earned the katar the
nickname, "punch dagger".  This katar has engravings of a growling panther upon
its blade.  The handle is wrapped in black leather.

deep violet silk and is designed to 'hug' the form of the wearer.  The leather
cuirass which hides beneath is thin, and very, very supple.  It too is designed
to hug the wearers form, and in fact mold to their features.  While not as
effective as a full leather vest, it certainly provides a decent amount of
protection.

cuirass decorated leather~
   These are progressive times, and as such, women fight as equals among the
men.  It is a challenge of armorers to make armor that will fit their bodies
properly, and this is one example of such armor.  This piece of armor is what
is known as a cuirass, which is more or less a simple breastplate.  This
particular cuirass has been fitted for a woman of "generous" proportions, and
bears engraved patterns to increase its attractiveness as a piece of armor.  
The leather used to construct this cuirass has been specially treated to
increase its hardness, thus providing a bit more protection than an average
piece of leather armor.

--== THE GODS OF LIGHT ==--


** Paladine, the Platinum Dragon **  
Paladine is Father of Good and Master of Law. He speaks for the gods
of Good, leading through example and encouragement. He upholds
the laws of Good by assisting the righteous and renouncing the evil.
Paladine and Takhisis were the creators of the first material things,
the dragons. Takhisis corrupted the chromatic dragons, leaving the
metallics to Paladine, and this act began the rift between Good and

--== THE GODS OF NEUTRALITY ==--


** Gilean, the Void **
Before creation, the High God wrote the Tobril, the book of all knowledge
and true names, to lay down the designs of the universe. The High God
did not consider any of the gods he created trustworthy enough to guard
the Tobril, so he found Gilean, a scribe so scrupulous as to have never
penned an error and entrusted the Tobril to him. Gilean guards the Tobril
and is the patriarch of the Neutral gods. His symbol is an open book
and his color is gray.


** Lunitari, the Veiled Maiden **
The goddess of Neutral magic and illusions, Lunitari was born of Gilean and
an unknown mother, though some suggest she sprang full-grown from her
father's thoughts. She founded the Order of the Red Robes to promote
Neutral magic. Her symbol is a red circle or sphere, her color red or magenta.


** Sirrion, the Flowing Flame **
Sirrion is the god of creative flame and natural power and sculpts fire into
beautiful forms. He controls every flame, from the sun to the low-burning
wick. His companion is Shinare, an argumentative couple due to his
temperamental and artistic nature in conflict with her practicality and
opportunism. His symbol is a multi-colored fire. His colors are bright red
and yellow.


** Reorx, the Forge **
The god of manufacture, technology and metallurgy, Reorx is considered by
the dwarves of Ansalon to be the greatest god. Humans perceive him as
merely Kiri-Jolith's helper. Reorx tamed chaos to forge the world. His second
greatest creation, the Greystone of Gargath, led to the emergence of dwarves,
gnomes and kender and many consider him the father of these races. His
symbols are a forging hammer or dwarven hammer (Thorbardin). His colors
are slate grey and red.


** Chislev, the Beast **
Chislev is nature incarnate. According to legend, the seasons change with the
moods of her heart. She is served by every beast and plant. Her symbol is
a feather of brown, yellow and green, which are her colors.


** Zivilyn, the Tree of Life **
Zivilyn is the god of all wisdom and is the celestial Tree of Life. His
branches extend into all times and places. As Gilean holds the knowledge of
the universe, Zivilyn holds its wisdom. Zivilyn is the companion of Chislev,
a relationship seen by most mortals as a perfect marriage. Zivilyn's
symbol is a great green or gold tree, sometimes a vallenwood. His colors
are green and gold.


** Shinare, Winged Victory **
Shinare, the goddess of wealth, industry and commerce, has many dwarven
worshippers. She also finds many followers among merchants, mercenaries
and profit-minded adventurers of other races. She is considered by all to
be the champion of freedom and self-destiny. She cannot tolerate laziness

--== THE GODS OF DARKNESS ==--


/i4 **Takhisis, Queen of Darkness**
Takhisis is the embodiment of evil, enjoying preying on the weaknesses of
others and using the greatest desires to enslave them. She is cold and
brilliant, a master of exploitation. She hates good, loves cruelty and hoards
wealth. In the Age of Dreams, she was Paladine's mate and consort but when they
forged the first beings, the dragons, Takhisis grew selfish and corrupted the
chromatic dragons. She left Paladine and now consorts with Sargonnas, a god
of fury and vengeance. The passion between them vacillates between insatiable
lust and deep loathing. They bore two children, Nuitari and Zeboim. Takhisis'
one other child, Artha, the demigoddess of wanton lust and greed was sired
by Hiddukkel masquerading as Chemosh. Takhisis' symbol is a black
crescent. Her color is black of utter darkness and irridescent black of beetle
wings. Her influences are over night, evil dragons, hatred, intrigue and chaos.


** Nuitari, Devouring Dark **
Nuitari is the god of black magic and the son of Takhisis and Sargonnas. He
founded the Order of the Black Robes, perhaps the most secret and coveted
Order on Krynn. While those that practice black magic may gain incredible
power, it comes at the price of control. Nuitari watches in wry amusement as
those who try to master his art are overcome by its dark power. His symbol
is a black circle or sphere, his color is black.


** Sargonnas, Dark Vengeance **
Takhisis' consort, Sargonnas is the sometimes explosive god of vengeance,
rage, deserts and volcanoes. He embodies the destructive passion of fire.
As Takhisis is both his greatest ally and his greatest enemy, he plots both
for and against her. He is treacherous and paranoid, and works his revenge
through insidious means. His symbol is a red condor or a red fist
(Thorbardin, Istar). His colors are red and black.


** Morgion, the Black Wind **
This god of decay and disease refuses the company of other gods and does
not discuss plans with them. He despises all healthy things, actively striving
to corrupt them with disease and decay. His symbols are a hood with two
red eyes, an upside-down axe (Thorbardin) or a rat's claw (Hylo). His colors
are deep brown and black.


** Chemosh, Lord of Death **
In the Age of Dreams, Chemosh was drawn to Krynn by Takhisis, to serve as
a lieutenant to marshal the legions of death. As lord of false redemption,
Chemosh offers eternal life to the unwary. Recipients spend immortality in
an undead and eternally corrupted body while he himself grows in power
and longevity. His symbol is a yellow skull. His colors are black and a
sickly yellow.


** Zeboim, Darkling Sea **
Zeboim, the Sea Queen, is the impetuous and volatile daughter of
Takhisis and Sargonnas. Her unpredictable tempers make her a dangerous
foe and lethal friend. She provides her followers the vast wealth of lost
treasure ships. She receives petitions and sacrifices from seamen wishing
good weather and safe travel. Those who displease her through some real
or imagined slight never see harbor again. Her symbol is a turtle-shell
pattern, and her colors are green and red.


**Hiddukel, Prince of Lies **
This god of ill-gotten wealth and deals is the patron god of evil businessmen
and dishonest merchants. Greed and mischief drive all Hiddukel's
transactions. He controls all ill-gotten wealth, using it to corrupt honest and
greedy men alike. His symbol is a set of broken merchant's scales. His
colors are red and bone white.
