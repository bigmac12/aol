   A White Robed wizard must follow the ways of good and keep this goal in mind
in all that he does.  Acts contrary to the mandate of good can eventually
result in the downfall of the wizard.  One of the first indications that a

affects his abilities.

The Three Foundations of Wizardry

1.  All wizards are brothers in their order.  All orders are
brothers in the power.

2.  The places of High Wizardry are held in common among
all orders and no sorcery is to be used there in anger against
fellow wizards.

3.  The world beyond the walls of the towers may bring brother
against brother and order against order, but such is the way of the
universe.

   A powerful wizard of the Red Robes, Magius was a childhood friend of Huma's.
Their friendship was very unusual since most Knights are distrustful of
magic-users.  At the time of Magius, mages where not permitted to carry any
weapons other than their magic.  A wizard was expected to be protected by
warriors and to get out of any battle if he felt himself becoming weak.  
Because of this stricture, Magius always fought side by side with Huma.  
During one of the battles, the two were separated.  Although he had a chance to
escape, Magius stayed and fought until his magic gave out.  Having no other
weapon, the weakened mage was quickly overwhelmed and taken to the Dark Queen
as a prize.  Magius was tormented and tortured until he died.  Huma grieved
deeply and prayed to Paladine that Magius's sacrifice be remembered.  Paladine
answered his prayers and, from that day, all wizards have been permitted to
carry daggers in remembrance of Magius.
