jagged edges of the thick glass appear razor sharp and catch the light with a
sharp glimmer.  A large portion of the glazed writing on it can still be read.
It seems the bottle hails from Bayguard, a city north of the Icewall, which
would be amazing until you remember, this is Kendermore.

bottle swirling colors~
   This bottle is barely larger than your hand.  The bottle is fairly
inexpensive looking.  It is a cylinder with a glass bottom and the top of it is
a little less wide.  A small cork stopper is placed on the top of it to keep it
from spilling everywhere.  The contents of the bottle are rather odd looking.
It is two colors swirling together, a bright pink color and a sapphire blue,
mixing around in the bottle, but never truly coming together.    

To use this, just type:  &Rquaff bottle&n
It will take you back to where you last rented.

strength.  The studs, which are not overly pointed, extend about a quarter inch
from the edges of the armor.

   Soft, and rather beautiful, thesess boots are also highly favored for
traveling.  Thick leather soles with cotton inserts make for quiet, yet
comfortable travel into the farthest of lands.  Rain, sleet, hail, or snow,
they will continuously keep the wearer's feet dry.

mace oak~
   At first glance the size of this mace would seem to indicate that it would
not be much help in a battle.  To the trained eye, however, the material from
which this mace was crafted holds the key to its ability to see victory.  The
