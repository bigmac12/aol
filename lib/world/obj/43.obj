eyepatch black simple eye patch cloth cord~
   This eyepatch is attractive in its simplicity.  It is made of some unknown
material, but is glossy and black.  It is made to fit over one eye or another.
The eyepatch serves two uses: it can cover the unsightly injury left by a
missing eye, obviously.  Less obviously, buccaneers are known to wear
eyepatches even though they have two good eyes.  The reason is that, when one
goes belowdecks on a raided ship, the eyepatch can then be swung over to the
other eye, allowing the raider to see in the dark better than those who have
gone from the sun and sea to the relative darkness of the bowels of the ship,
giving them a significant advantage over those poor souls aboard the ships they
attack.

book small~
   This small book has a title written in a script that resembles nothing so
much as the doodle of a bored child.  However, upon further reflection, the
pattern is actually quite logical - strange, but logical.  The pages are lined
with diagrams and listings of numbers, detailing natural systems and laws.  If
you could make sense of it, it would be a valuable find indeed.

anklet cobalt chain strands large gemstones~
   This anklet is made of a thin cobalt chain, and has large gemstones fastened
to it by little golden clips.  The gems alternate in a pattern between
sapphires, rubies, and emeralds, with a continuing pattern of blue, red, and
green.  The anklet jingles when the wearer walks.  Each gemstone is rather
large, and by itself could fetch quite a good price.

   This hood has been generously cut from a bolt of linen, and dyed a beautiful
deep violet color.  Clasps on the back of the hood allow it to be attached to a
cloak or robe.  Though unadorned, it seems to be a fine garment.  It looks to
have been treated with some agent to help waterproof it.  When raised the hood
would obscure nearly the entire face of even the largest of humanoids.

staff ogham druid tall simple ash ashwood wood wooden crafted~
   This long, straight staff is made of a light, creamy-colored ashwood.  Ash
is amongst the hardest of the natural woods, and is ideal in crafting weapons,
weapon handles, or in the construction of small homes.  Small strips of leather
have been wrapped around the staff near the top and bottom, designed as hand
grips.  A small, strange pattern has been engraved below the top grip, and
above the bottom grip.

loose allowing the cloth to breathe.  As a result they are not as warm as their
thickness and weight might seem to indicate.  Simple clasps fasten them at the
waist and neckline.
