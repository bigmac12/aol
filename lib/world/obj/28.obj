knife carving bone bone-handled~
   While rather old and well-used, this knife still appears to have many good
years left.  Approximately eight inches in over-all length, the blade consists
of five inches of slightly pitted iron, yet it still holds a razor sharp edge
when properly honed.  The handle is formed of rough sculpted bone, likely taken
from a deer or other large mammal taken as game from about the local forests.

smaller limbs as it aged and became covered underneath new growth above it.  
Appearing to have once been part of an even larger limb, this is what must have
been the largest section, closest to the trunk of the tree itself.  The ends
are somewhat jagged, appearing to have been snapped in a fierce wind storm some
time ago.  It is sturdy and not overly weighty and may be used with some
comfort as a walking stick, or possibly as a make-shift club of sorts.

daggers main blade is sharp and very similar to that of any other dagger, the
two others do not seem to be overly sharp, yet they are remarkably thick and
strong.  Ideally, the weapon is designed for off-hand use, where the triple
blades may be used to entrap an opponents blade.  Once entrapped, the wielder
of the swordbreaker may give the weapon a violent twist, hoping to either break
their opponent's blade or disarm them.

   This small dagger is sturdy of build yet shows very little in the way of
precision or decor.  The slim, short blade in forged of steel ages past and has
since fallen to some neglect, becoming dull, pitted, and lack-luster.  The
hilt, however, has since been re-wrapped in soft leather dyed a light azure in
color, lending it some added comfort in use.

polished to a high sheen and curves with a slight, gentle arc.  Cut of glass
and elegantly sculpted, the thin hilt is etched with several small runes and
encircled by patterns of ivy and vines gilded in gold.  Perhaps meant as a last
reserve, or perhaps to prevent its loss to persons of unsavory character,
strong magiks have been worked upon this piece to mask it from the prying eyes
of others.

   This is a very unusual item indeed.  It is a ball of pure dark energy,
nether light.  It sucks in all of the darkness around it as though darkness
were a tangible thing, which actually results in providing light to the area.
While it defies all traditional logic and scientific thought, magic often has a
logic all its own.  It is harmful to touch nether energy for too long, as it
has not yet been fully studied, and only the foolhardy would stay in prolonged
contact with such a malignant thing.
