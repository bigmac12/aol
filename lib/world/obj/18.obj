locket tiny silver~
   Looking fragile enough to be broken by even casual treatment, this locket is
no doubt a symbol of the affection of a man for a woman.  The chain is very
thin, made of shining silver.  The locket is shaped like a heart, and engraved
inside it is an inscription.

cudgel shillelagh blackthorn wooden wood ogham druid~
   This cudgel has been crafted from blackthorn, making this a traditional
druidic tool which is referred to as a 'Shillelagh'.  The blackthorn tree is
sometimes thought of more as a shrub, with dark, twisted branches that usually
grow no higher than thirteen feet in height.  As its name suggests the
blackthorns bark is black in color, and is covered with many extremely sharp
thorns.  The wood itself is very sturdy and this, in addition to the thorns,
makes blackthorn an ideal wood for making a natural weapon from.  A Shillelagh
is usually crafted from the base and root of a blackthorn tree, as the root
provides a natural 'knob' at the tip of the cudgel.  This Shillelagh is
undecorated, save for a small pattern carved just under the knob of the cudgel.
