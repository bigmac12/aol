bastard sword hilted~
   Also called a hand-and-a-half sword, this bastard sword is surely the work
of a master craftsman.  The steel is so strong and sharp that it seems as
though it could cut stone.  Though it would be a shame to use such a fine
weapon thus.  Its hilt is wonderfully shaped and though it appears delicate,
testing reveals that it is actually quite strong and likely will never break
under normal usage.  It is also immediately apparent to anyone who touches the
weapon that it has been enchanted somehow.

   These thick steel gauntlets are made of an unusual white steel that looks as
though it has been covered in frost.  They are rather large, and have studded
knuckles.  They are fully articulated and do little to impair the use of one's
hands.  For their apprarent thickness, they are rather light.

hat wide-brimmed purple yellow feather~
   This wide-brimmed purple hat might appear to some as ridiculous, but to the
flamboyant it is the height of fashion.  It is made from a fine-quality purple
velvet that keeps its shape rather well.  Tucked into the wide band around the
hat is an immense yellow feather that appears to be a tail feather from some
immense bird.  How the hat looks is mostly dependant on the one wearing it.  
While a good look for some, on others, it would look positively preposterous.

axe battleaxe battle sturdy dwarven~
   The dwarves prefer the use of heavier weapons such as axes and hammers, and
as a result, most dwarven warriors prefer weapons of that type.  Dwarves seldom
make things for non-dwarves, so this axe has been weighted for the shorter,
stouter folk to use.  In the hands of any other, it would be too clumsy to be
of much use.  The handle is relatively short, and atop the shaft is a
double-bladed axe.  Each side of the blade has been relieved with the markings
of the Hylar clan.  There is a large leather loop around the end of the handle,
allowing it to be hooked onto a belt or swung around one's hand.

   This wide shoulder sash is made of fine thick cloth of unknown origin.  Its
entire length has been decorated with silver thread, embroidered into shapes
representative of and sacred to dwarves.  The sash is pinned to the shoulder by
a gawdy gold brooch.  The ends of the sash have silver tassles attached to
them.  It would appear that this is some sort of regalia worn by dwarves of
importance.

warhammer hammer dwarven antique~
   This huge, one-handed warhammer has been made by dwarves, for dwarves.  Its
weight and balance makes it useable only by those with a low center of gravity.
Taller folks would find the weight of the swing almost impossible to wield
without knocking onesself over.  The head of the hammer is very large, and
appears to be made of dark steel.  The head is two-sided, so that it can be
effective on the backswing as well.  The head is engraved with the symbols of
each dwarven clan, the most dominant being the symbol of the Hylar clan.  The
handle is solid oak, and has been whittled with patterns depicting a brief
history of the Dwarven people and their delving of Thoradin.  The hammer
appears to be very old, but is still in fabulous condition.

platemail plate blackened suit dwarven steel~
   The dwarven craftsmen are renouned for their armor.  There is no other armor
on Krynn quite like it.  First of all, its craftsmanship is unique in that it
is some of the thickest, heaviest armor in creation.  This does little to
improve the wearer's flexibility.  This thickness does afford one excellent
protection however.  The armor itself is relatively plain.  Another thing
stands out about this armor.  It has been sized and shaped very specifically to
fit only one kind of wearer: A dwarf.  Anyone else trying to wear the armor
would have to do such extensive modifications that they would have to
completely resize the armor, thereby losing most of its protection.  It is a
suit of armor that covers the entire body of the wearer, from head to toe.

   This beautiful quiver is made of reeds and is held together by apparently
invisible bindings.  Each reed has been notched and scorched slightly to create
a pattern resembling a glittering diamond.  Only the elves are capable of this
sort of exquisite and seamless craftsmanship.  The quiver is filled with elven
arrows, each of which is made by the secrets possessed only by the elven
fletchers.  Each individual arrow is a work of art, with a green shaft, blue
feathers, and an arrowhead sharper than Hiddukel himself.  The quiver comes
with a leather strap that allows it to be worn on the back or around the waist.

chain chainmail elven mithril suit~
   The material mithril is prized beyond any other metal.  The elves are known
for the suits of chainmail they construct using it.  A suit of elven mail is a
priceless heirloom and not intended for any but the finest elven warriors.  It
is almost as light as a cloth shirt, and protects better than armor twenty
times as heavy.  It is so comfortable that it can be worn without padding, and
there is never threat of chafing or pinching.

it.  This elven longsword is of surpassing quality, made of an ultra
lightweight mithril, from hilt to tip.  It is covered with etchings depicting
vines and stars.  It hums softly when drawn, indicating perhaps some magical
enchantment.

   This is a truly beautiful garment, and because of its nature it can be worn
in many different ways.  It is a long white net made of gossamer threads that
resemble thin glittering spiderwebs.  It is a type of material that you have
not seen before.  This net is intertwined with tiny, ever-blossoming flowers,
and smells simply heavenly.  It provides warmth which would ward off even the
strongest winter chill despite its simple and delicate appearance.  It radiates
with holy energy.  Only the elves in their woodland homes could craft such a
beautiful garment.
