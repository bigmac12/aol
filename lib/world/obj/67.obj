bow longbow~
   This is a finely crafted longbow, very light and the bow itself carved from
a single piece of wood.  It is a recurve bow, curved in at the ends and then
arching to a graceful bend down the middle.  The string is very tight and taut,
with just the right amount of tension to be pulled without too much strain.  
The pommel is carved into the shape of a griffin, and fits your palm perfectly.
