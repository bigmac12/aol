basket fishing wicker~
   As steadfast fishermen, the villagers know simplicity allows more time for
fishing.  Thus the Bayside Fishing Basket was created and has been used for
many years.  Fishermen pack provisions for the day (lunch, bait, tackle, etc)
all in one basket, and off they go.  They can sit on the basket and fish, then
eat their lunch and fish some more.  When the day is over, they load the basket
back up with the days catch.    

   This fine basket has two sturdy leather straps attached to its back.  These
straps allow it to be worn on the back when travelling too and from a favorite
fishing spot.
