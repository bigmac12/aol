river~
   This section of the river is rather fast-moving.  As a result the waters do
not maintain their normal muddy color but rather they are a clear blue that
sparkles in the midday sun.

cloak ivory trimmed brown edging~
   Cut from very sturdy material, this long cloak has been dyed a rich ivory
color, and trimmed in brown edging.  Stitched with precision, silver thread has
been used to form one of the symbols of the diety Kiri-Jolith; a horned
battleaxe, which decorates the back of this beautiful garment.  The thickly
padded interior provides excellent protection against both the elements and the
blade.

broadsword single-edged hilt bone~
   Made from precious steel, the blade of this sword holds a razor's edge.  
Crafted through a process of folding the steel many times this broadsword is
almost unbreakable.  The edge has a gradual curve, while the spine is straight,
the entire piece leading smoothly into the hilt.  The sides of the blade have
been acid-etched with a mottling pattern and stamped near the hilt with a paw
print - the signature of the smith that forged it.  The hilt is made from the
polished femur of an unknown animal, then wrapped in sharkskin to ensure a firm
grip at all times.
