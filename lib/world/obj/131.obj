obsidian large statue Sirrion~
   Resting heavily within the very center of a fiery pool of lava, stands this
large statue, obviously enchanted to withstand the heat.  Formed of sleek,
black obsidian, this statue has been masterfully crafted to resemble the image
of a large and powerfully built man.  So realistic is the artwork that the cold
eyes of the statue seem to follow one's path about the chamber and the sculpted
hair seems to almost waver as do the flames around it.  Gripped within the
statue's mighty hands is a massive blade, impressively carved, wreathed in
flame.

statue dragon impressive spewing flame ~
   Crafted by an expert mason, this large statue is of remarkable quality, so
detailed as to make one almost nervous to stand beside it unwatched.  
Masterfully formed in the image of dragon, the statue stands, its four claws to
the ground, back arched slightly.  Its long serpentine neck snakes upwards, maw
tilted to the sky, flames spewing forth to a height of several feet.  The
plating covering the statue seems to have an odd quality about it, seeming to
at one angle appear gold, another red, while basking in the surounding
firelight.

   This small altar has been well crafted from one solid piece of volcanic
obsidian, carefully tooled in the form of a single flame.  Set within several
of the twists and flows along the altar's surface are many small niches, most
holding candles, but a few left bare, likely in reserve for some form of
ceremony.

   This massive pillar has been crafted of the surrounding basalt, its mottled
greys polished to a dull gleam as it soars upwards to the darkness of the
ceiling above.  Crafted and formed by a master stonemason, this giant pillar
has been formed to represent nothing as much as a tremendous column of fire
roaring from floor to ceiling.  Several persons could ring the base of this
column, their fingers just barely touching around the circumference.

   This kilt is a masterwork of dwarven smithies, forged of bronze and copper
plates engraved with the pattern of flames.  The heavy plates are weighted and
interlinked perfectly giving this garment far more manuverability than one
might first attribute it at a glance.  Lined with a polished layer of
interwoven brass rings, this garment offers excellent protection against all
forms of weapons.

spear iron red-hot smoldering~
   This long spear has been masterfully crafted of iron, its style and markings
of an age long since passed.  It is somewhat heavy and cumbersome, requiring a
two-handed grip even from the largest of warriors, its weight and length making
it a difficult choice in close quarters.  Its length is left entirely to bare
metal and appears blackened as if by a great fire, its jaggedly barbed head
still glowing red-hot.

in polished brass, this entire suit appears to be blackened as if by great
fire, refusing to take a shine no matter how well polished.  Lined with a layer
of heavy cloth the color of flame, this breastplate is ever warm to the touch,
even radiating a gentle heat in the coldest of climes.

chain weighted long flame~
   This long, weighted chain may make for a wickedly elegant weapon when held
by the hands of one skilled in its use.  Nearly ten feet in length, it is a
weapon that requires a good deal of strength and manual dexterity to use
effectively.  When wielded by a master it may be used to attack and defend in
tandum and its length may easily wrap around shield or legs.  Forged of
blackened iron links and several heavy, blunt weights, it is set with three
large, polished bronze rings that are likely used as handholds.  The word
'Tendril' has been etched into one of the rings and when spoken will set alight
the end lengths of chain with blazing flame.

   This slender vial looks rather fragile, having been formed almost entirely
of thin, clear glass.  It is capped at the top with a polished brass lid,
sealed tight against its surroundings until opened for use.  Looking at the
contents within the glass, it seems as though a wisp of flame has been captured
and set to reside within.  Despite the appearance of the flame within, the
glass and brass lid are suprising cool to the touch, as though unaffected by
the contents it holds.

either man or woman and it may be easily adjusted to many varying body types.
Loose and flowing of its own, the several leather laces at both arms and neck
make this garment easily altered at a moments notice.  Light embroidery scrolls
about the surface of the garment, set with a black thread as to produce a quite
subtle, yet remarkably stylish, pattern.

   This pair of leggings have been crafted of fine suede dyed black by the
hands of a expert tailor.  The suede itself has been tailored to be stretched
tight, inset in a few spaces with smooth, black silk, which lend the garment a
far wider range of mobility than would be expected from such a piece.  Worked
across the surface of the material are the twining images of flame embroidered
in black thread, nearly undetectible until presented for close inspection.  
Eyelets reinforced in silver travel the entire length of each leg, the gap
between inset with fine silk the color of flame and laced with lacings of black
silken cord which allow for a wide range of tightness and fit.

   This long staff has been artfully forged of iron, twisted and left blackened

whether some trick of craftsmanship or magic it is hard to tell without
detailed inspection.  The wrought iron staff is topped with a small eagle's
claw set of polished bronze and tipped at the opposing end with a cap of
similar material.  Clutched within the staff's top is a fist-sized egg of
polished fire opal that almost seems to glow from within with a dull, fiery
light.  A small wrapping of black leather graces the midsection, allowing for
greater comfort and ease of use.

wear by those of the female persuasion.  Close cut and styled in a rather
revealing fashion, it does much to trim and accentuate.  The entire work has
been patterned with fine stitched embroidery in black thread, creating subtle
styling and added flair without demanding attention.  Small slits have been
worked into the material along the sides, under the arms, and set with fine
leather laces which allow for some further measure of adjustment.

appearance of an open flame.
