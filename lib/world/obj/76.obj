      Then once its usefulness has passed, with water end its light,
       And into air the smoke doth pour, and fades into the night.

Southwest water sits in wait, and southeast there is naught but the thin air.

wrists.  Each bracer is about a foot long, and large gemstones have been set
into it.  The edges of the bracers are engraved with magical writing, and they
have been enchanted somehow, though one would likely have to wear them to find
out how.

mirror phydia's phydia reflection shiny silver~
   This hand-held mirror is made of a shiny reflective silver metal, with an
odd glimmer of magic about it.  The handle is made of ivory and intricately
engraved.  Written in flowing script upon the base of the mirrored surface is
the name, "Phydia".  The mirror was created by the archmage Phydia in one of
her earlier attempts to create an item that would help protect the one holding
it from magical attacks.

gem multifaceted deep indigo dark purple tiny ioun stone~
   This gem is small enough to fit into the palm of the hand, and is a dark
color of indigo.  Its multiple facets catch and reflect the light in a very
eye-catching manner.  It does not sit upon the ground, nor in any surface.  
Instead, it floats about, and when placed over the head, it starts to float
around magically, suspended in midair by arcane forces.

staff long gold wood staff gold-inlaid vallenwood large diamond gem glowing~
   The favored weapons of mages, this particular staff looks to be heavily
enchanted.  It is about seven feet in length, and made of solid vallenwood with
gold decorations.  The top of the staff holds a large multifaceted diamond
which glows with a soft light.  The entire staff is covered with mystical
runes, and pulses with a strange energy.  It is quite light to hold and wield
though, and is no doubt a formidable artifact.
