cover.  Apparently the elf, when alive, was tortured, and now his body is being
used for other, darker purposes.

How do I become a mage?

    Ah, finally the question that most, if not all, of
 you have been waiting for. Alas, there is no easy way
 to become a mage. The first step is to seek a wizard
 who is willing to teach you the rudiments of magic.

    It is imperative, though optional, to do this.
 Otherwise, the proper use of magic and the proper way
 to harness it will become lost on you. If you prove to
 be a competent student, your shalafi (the elven word
 for teacher) will notify the Conclave that you are
 ready for the test.

    The Test is a grueling gauntlet that will push you
 to your limits. There is very little you can do to
 prepare for the Test except to practice your spells
 and listen well to your teachers. To some who take the
 Test, it is the last thing they will ever do, while to
 others it may leave them scarred for life. Whatever
 the case, the Test will determine whether you are
 worthy enough to join the ranks of the Conclave.

Final Words

    I will leave you with my observations, young
 mageling. The art of spellcraft is very much alike to
 the art of spinning thread. Both require a skilled and
 practiced hand and one mistake will ruin the spell or
 the piece of fabric. Years of study lie ahead of you,
 if you are ready to embrace your fate then stride
 boldly forward. Good luck.

What are renegade wizards?

    Renegade wizards are wizards who dwell outside
 the Conclave's influence. In other words, wizards who
 use strong magic and do not join the Conclave. A
 renegade can be anyone, from an ambitious novice to
 a Tested wizard who has revoked the vows that he or
 she had taken upon entering the Conclave.

How are renegade wizards dealt with?

    If a wizard of the Conclave discovers the
 existence of a renegade, the wizard is responsible
 for reporting the discovery to the Conclave. The
 Conclave then decides who is to go and confront the
 renegade. The chosen wizard can be from any of the
 orders.

    A white robed wizard will always offer the
 renegade a chance to stop his or her ways and join
 the Conclave. If the renegade refuses, the wizard
 will try to send the renegade to another realm
 where they can do no harm.

    A red robed wizard may offer the renegade a chance
 to join the Conclave. However, if the renegade refuses
 the wizard may terminate the renegade or send the
 renegade to a barren and isolated realm.

    A black robed wizard cares little for the well
 being of a renegade. Should the renegade prove to be
 strong in the arcane, the black robed wizard MAY offer
 the chance to join the order of the Black Robes, however
 it is more likely that the wizard may just execute the
 renegade on the spot.

What is the Conclave?

    The Conclave, an order founded by the three gods of
 magic, Solinari the White Moon, Lunitari the Red Moon,
 and Nuitari the Black Moon. It is the Conclave that
 watches over the magic of the world.

    During the Second Dragonwar, the mortal races were
 under the threat of total annihilation once again by
 Takhisis and the chromatic dragons. It was then that
 the three gods of magic selected three individuals
 from the race of mortals. These three were taken up to
 the moons and taught to harness and control magic.

    This magic differed from the innate magic found
 in dragons and other magical creatures. This new magic
 was called "High Sorcery" and rivaled the magic of
 the dragons, also known as "primal magic".

    After the chromatic dragons were defeated, the
 gods of magic bestowed the Curse of the Magi and
 the Foundations of the Conclave unto the wizards of
 the world. The Curse of the Magi is the geas that
 resides with anyone who wields the power of the
 arcane.

    Spells, once they have been used, are erased from
 the spellcaster's memory, requiring the spellcaster to
 memorize the spell again. It also causes the spellcaster
 to become weary as he or she casts more spells
 continuously.

What is magic?                                                                  

    A tool? Power? Spells? A means to an end? If these
 were your answers, you would only be partially correct. Above
 all else, magic is a gift from the gods.

    Like any gift from the gods, magic should be
 handled carefully and with reverence. I have seen too many
 youths handle magic carelessly and become consumed by their
 own ambitions and foolishness. This, above all else, I am
 trying to prevent by writing this book.

   Greetings young mageling. Welcome to, for some of
you, the first steps into the world of the arcane. It
is a world of wander and danger with hours of long
hard work that bear little rewards. Many have walked
this path only to turn back or perish along the way.

   Still reading? Good. The path of a wizard is not
for the faint of heart. Now let us begin.

Those who have achieved the status of mage should seek out able apprentices
to assist them in their endeavors and to ensure the continuation of the
magickal arts for future generations.

In addition to any personalized training, an apprenticeship should include
the following.

->Presentation of a suitable book of preliminary spells for review and the
study of proper documentation.
->The successful identification of a scroll or potion through research and
analysis.  This information may be included in the 'Compendium of Scrolls
and Potions' as compiled by the Conclave of Mages.
->A visit to Delusen's Academy.
->Accompaniment to the Tower of High Sorcery once Testing has been scheduled.
There the student can tour the grounds and libraries while awaiting their
Testing.
