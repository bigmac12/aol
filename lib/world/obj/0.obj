trout put up a rather fiesty fight.  Their name is a bit misleading, as they
are not rainbow colored, but are generally a steel-blue, blue-green, or
yellow-green in color depending on what type of water source they were fished
from.  The flesh of rainbow trout tends to be a vivid red in color, or light
pink if fished from a lake rather than a river or stream.  They make for a
decent meal.

pounds or so, much like this one.  When cleaned and cut into fillets, a fish
this size could probably feed five or six people.  The ideal preperation for

drum hand handdrum windmill~
   This is a windmill style hand drum, often found in temples and monastaries.
It consists of two small stones, attached to either side of a small drum with
twine.  The drum itself is set atop a short handle, which is rolled between the
hands.  This motion causes the stones to swing, striking the drum to produce a
beat.  Often these drums are painted and carved with designs, and this one is
no exception.  Painted on the skin of the drum is a picture of a hand, holding
symbols of each element.  The handle of the drum is carved with a swirling,
wind-like pattern.

robes novice simple~
   These robes are faintly grey in color and are of a thick woolen material.  
The edges are trimmed with a wide-strip of ribbon of the same color, and, when
worn nearly reach the ground.  The only distinguishing marking on the thick
cloth is a small emblem in the corner, hastily made to look like that of the
Conclave of Mages.  A mage of the Conclave would recognize the emblem as fake
if they looked closely, however.

   At first glance, this small leather-bound book to be a journal.  It is only
upon opening it and perusing a few of the pages that one might guess that this
is a novice mage's spellbook.  These 'primers' as they are known, are often
given to early students of magic so that they might practice and learn their
spells.

moustache solamnic long~
   This long, solamnic-style moustache looks like quite the real article,
leading one to wonder if some Knight is wandering around looking for his facial
hair.  More likely is that this excellent copy is made from horse, or some
other animal's hair.  The only feasible application of this would be as a
practical joke, no doubt.

history family coat arms forgery~
   A heraldic device is made of a number of charges (objects, creatures, or
geometric shapes) arranged on a field (or background).  Ideally, the result is
simple, memorable, and easily identified.  The heralds restrict the possible
colors, poses, and arrangements of charges in a device.  They do not restrict
the objects or creatures you can choose from (except that you may only use
period objects or creatures).  Any good forgery, including this one, will
follow the these guidelines in order to appear legitimate.

   This lovely family crest also comes with a complete family tree,
demonstrating its noble lineage.

putty face~
   This is an application of face putty, used for a variety of purposes.  Its
main application is in theater or performance-work, when one wishes to modify
their appearance in order to fit a particular part better.  When molded to a
person's features, it can look quite realistic.  Some of the more devious sort
prefer to use face putty to aid in disguising themselves.
