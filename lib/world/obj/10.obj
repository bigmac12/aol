   The fabric of the dress is so fine, it seems impossible to believe that any
mortal could ever have created it.  The fabric of the gown is woven from
thousands of strands of silken fibers, interspersed with threads of silver and
gold and glistening white, which when combined with the deep blue of the silk,
makes the gown shimmer and sparkle in the light like it was woven from hundreds
of glittering sapphires.  The dress is fairly simple in cut, a plain shift
without beading or adornment that clings to the wearer's body gracefully,
draping from the waist to the feet in magnificent fashion.  The dress is
fastened at both shoulders with silver clips, formed into a figure eight, and
sleeveless, with a deep, scooped neckline and a slight gathering of fabric at
the feet.
