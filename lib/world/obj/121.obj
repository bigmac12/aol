portraying a large tree flanked by a pair of unicorns.  The roots of the tree
dig deep into the ground, snaking off in all sorts of directions.  The sky
behind the tree is white, lit by a yellow sun with spiralling yellow rays
extending from it.  The crest is not one that is easily recognizeable, though
the shield appears to be relatively new.  The shield is rather heavy, and has
been sturdily reinforced.  There are a few large straps upon the back, allowing
it to be easily worn on the arm and gripped to prevent it being dropped.

   This lightly woven piece of black linen has been rougly cut into a long
strip, about eight inches in width.  So rough is the edging that it appears as
if it were hastily cut with a knife or some other type of blade rather than the
a pair of sewing shears.  The loose weave of the fibers makes the fabric
breathe and makes this strip of linen an excellent candidate for a breath
muffle.  Used by those preferring to keep their presence unnoticed, a breath
muffle is worn over the nose and mouth to quiet the sound of its wearers
breathing.

with the flames around it being a dark, but brilliant azure blue flecked with
turqoise.  This beautiful coloration truly makes it seem as though the phoenix
is rising from blue flame.  A tiny diamond has been placed as the phoenix's
eye.

a male ogre skull.  From the size, down to the smallest details it has been
flawlessy crafted so that one could not tell the difference from a real skull,
save the mineral it is constructed from.  It has also been crafted in such a
way that when held in an independent light source, it refracts the light to
shine out of the mouth and eyesockets creating an eerie display.  Despite the
skull being made of quartz, it is strangely as light as a feather and feels as
though at any moment it could float away.
