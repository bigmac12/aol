ranseur spear wooden-hafted steel~
   A ranseur is in the spear family of weapons, with additional blades to
enhance both its offensive and defensive capabilities.  Its secondary blades
are backward-hooking projections set well below the large central blade.  The
spearing function of this weapon is apparent, and the deflection abilities
include the trapping of opponent weapons in the space below the main blade.  
When a weapon is hooked there, a twist of the shaft would apply enough pressure
to either break the caught weapon or disarm its wielder.  The haft of this
ranseur is nearly six feet in length and made of highly-polished vallenwood.  
It has been wrapped with fine strips of leather and decorated with the banner
of the city of Solanthus.
