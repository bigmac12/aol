&ga forest green book&n~
A forest green book entitled 'Darkgnome Resources.'~
   ...  And their means of sustenance, which is a violet root known as
ka'dnneas, and an ore with the tendancy to emit deadly gasses when broken known
as Deser's Gold in our language, named after an outsider much like myself who
stumbled upon this culture and who discovered the mysterious ore several
hundreds of years ago.  From what I have gathered after teaching them bits of
the common tounge (their incredible capacity to learn almost anything instantly
is quite fascinating), they have eaten the root since the beginning of time,
and not only for its protein value, but also for its strange power to enhance
the brain's functioning for approximately three to six hours.  Could this
explain their incredible intellect, so oddly coupled with strange bloodlust and
unquenchable sadistic longings?  I have no doubt that I will eventually be
tortured and killed as they grow tired of me or have learned all they can from
me, but the chance to study such magnificent and horrific creatures is worth
the price.  On another note, the ore that they mine so furiously, Deser's Gold,
is a strange metal that is as hard as any steel, but when exposed to heat, it
melts like ice and stays in a liquid form with the consistency of pudding.  It
never heats up for even an instant, and as soon as Deser's Gold comes out of
the Great Furnace, it is safe to touch.  The darkgnomes can then rub the
substance on their chests, which they say then absorbs into their souls and
puts them on their magical plain of being.  They invited me to try the
substance, and reluctantly I did.  The world transformed around me, and things
began to pull at me...  I could reach out and move and transform them,
transform the air...  It was a truly terrifying experience for me, though I now
have a basic understanding of how darkgnome magic is worked...

A faded dark grey book lies here, entitled, 'Darkgnome Magic: Deser's Gold.'~
   ...  I have discovered only a little of how darkgnome magic works.  Mining
the ore known as Deser's Gold, in our tongue, they melt it in the Great Furnace
to a liquid with the consistency of pudding.  Then they store it, where it
stays in liquid form, and rub it on their chests when they wish to venture into
the world of magic.  After Deser's Gold absorbs into the skin, the world around
the user is dramatically changed from one of solid reality to one of complete
chaos.  Things and people twist and turn, often revealing hidden symbolic
identities too horrifying to look at.  After the feeling of shock is overcome,
however, users are able to manipulate their surroundings like a puppetmaster
might guide a marrionette.  The inexperienced darkgnome magic users are often
unable to control their urges or fears, and sometimes end up killing others or
destroying valuable items.  Some have been known to kill themselves.  While in
the world of magic, Deser's Gold acts as a channel for your mind, transforming
the physical world as you wish it to while you are in the magical world.  
However, your mind must be entirely clear and never wander astray, or else you
will fall pray to your own thoughts.  Only the most disciplined can become
darkgnome mages, and thus, very few are.  In most cases a novice magic user
will die before he or she can reach mastery...

a cracked leather-bound book~
A nearly ancient-looking leather-bound book, cracked from age, lies here.~
   ..  Have little to write about the Darkgnome Immortal.  Frankly, the
creature both fascinates and completely disgusts me.  It has been kept alive
for centuries by the half-living flesh of mineslaves "killed" by the fumes from
Deser's Gold.  Apparantly the magical ore's gas seeps into the body and
destroys the victim's lifeforce.  However, it replaces the life that was once
there with magic, keeping the mind and soul still in the body but unable to
control it.  The body becomes a cage, not allowing the soul to make its journey
into the afterlife.  Some darkgnome mages with unique abilities have found that
they can weld this half-living flesh to other flesh, and it will become apart
of the entity.  This was discovered some years before their messiah, a
darkgnome known now only as the Immortal, began to age and grow close to the
end of his years.  In desperation, bodies were magically fused with his, and
their lifeforces became his, their magical potential his.  He was able to live
another month, but as the corpses started to rot, his strength failed him.  
More bodies were massed around him, melded with his, and they renewed his
youth.  Eventually his entire lower half was covered in bodies, and he became a
stationary being atop a mound of flesh.  As the mound grew and grew, the amount
of half-corpses required each month became too many, and so they began
quartering and halving bodies to yield the maximum area of coverage.  You must
understand that the original bearers were still quite alive while all this was
happening, completely aware but unable to do a thing as they suffered horribly,
split open but unable to die.  It makes me ill to think of it.  I was once
invited to view the Immortal, and I hastily declined.  The darkgnomes took
great offense at it, unable to discern why I would not want to prostrate myself
before their "messiah" in his "chamber of life".  In fact, they have never
spoken to me the...

A torch with a small box attached close to the end of it is lying here.~
   The torch is normal except for a small polished wooden box near its end.  
The box has a tiny reed for a valve coming out of its top, which is plugged by
a tiny cork attached with a chain.  When the torchbearer wishes to light the
torch, all they need do is light the torch and uncork the valve, which emits
some sort of gas to keep the fire going.  The torch-cloth is somewhat flame
retardant, but after many hours of use, the cloth may burn away or the gas in
the box may run out.  Until then, the torch can be proclaimed Everlasting.
