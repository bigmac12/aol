hood sea green oversized~
   This hood has been generously cut from cotton, dyed a beautiful sea-green.
Clasps on the back of the hood allow it to be attached to a cloak or cape.  
Though unadorned, it seems to be a fine garment.  It looks to have been treated
with some agent to help waterproof it.  When raised the hood would obscure
nearly the entire face of even the largest of humanoids.

axe wrath destroyer~
   The pole of this impressive weapon is at least four feet in length and
fashioned from a sturdy hardwood.  It has been wrapped with strips of leather
to provide a good grip.  The leather is the brownish-red of dried blood.  
Sitting atop the pole is a massive curved axe.  The edge of the blade has been
sharpened to the point of appearing quite lethal.  The words 'Wrath of the
Destroyer' have been carved into the wooden handle.
