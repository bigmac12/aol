skull~
   This skull lies on one cheekbone, its jaw gaping open in what was perhaps
its final scream.  There is no evidence of the skeleton that once accompanied
it.

corpse elf white preserved well~
   The corpse is well preserved, and in decent shape.  The hair was probably
once a beautiful flowing white, yet is threatening to yellow.  The only
un-nerving thing about this corpse if the fact that the eyes have been gouged
out, and there are faint markings along the body, wherever the cloth does not
cover.  Apparently the elf, when alive, was tortured, and now his body is being
used for other, darker purposes.
