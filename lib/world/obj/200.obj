   It is said that Morgion, the Black Wind was seen in the town square
recently.  With that in mind, I have decided it would be a good time for a
vacation.  I hope everyone will get along well without me, but it was time for
me to take a break from my shop anyway.  I shall return within a week or two.

Oh to know all that has come, and all that will once more
To be able to see what will happen, and what has happened before
The Essence of All Knowledge can only be imagined at best
The Greatness of Wisdom sought after by those who cannot rest -
Oh to be blessed by the words of the Knowing One, to see present future and past
To be smiled upon by the God of Balance and to strive to make balance last
To understand that there cannot be Good or Evil Supreme
And to realize that knowledge is not all that it may seem -
Oh, God of the Book of Times Gone By and Times That Will Be
Give us the knowledge to look around us, and to truely see
Bless us with the wisdom to balance the world from within
And lead us ever onward as we pray to you, Mighty Gilean.

Scales of black, like obsidian glass
 Breath of acid to win the fight
A figure so bold wields power and magic
 The Queen of Darkness shows all Her Might.

Upon his songs of praise come devotion to protect the weak
Upon his mighty words come wisdom to right any wrong -

That he may guide us mere mortals on our perilous flight -
May his eyes ever watch over us, even as we stray
And forgive us our wrongs - make us better we pray

And lead us into your Light, oh Dragon of the Skies.
