unconventional.  The entire flail is crafted of moulded bronze, making it
extremely heavy.  The head and haft have been reinforced with iron bands;
further strengthening the weapon, but adding to its weight as well.  A
scrolling, swirling pattern has been etched along the entire length of the
flail; reminiscent of wind or breeze.  Looking at this pattern for more than a
few moments is captivating, and draws the viewer in.  Hidden within the pattern
are vile, cryptic runes which resonate with their own faint darkness.  The haft
has been wrapped in black leather where it is intended to be held, and a
gnarled rat's claw is etched into its base.

is a bit more than a simple scarf, and is actually closer to what some might

to be worn over a robe.  It is a shadowy, jet-black in color, and a subtle
skull-like pattern has been stitched into it in a slightly lighter shade.  One
might not even notice it unless they looked directly at the garment.  The stole
bears a high collar, which is trimmed with an earthen-brown edging to accent
it.  Two long strips of cloth extend from the stole, hanging down the front of
the wearer and ending at the knees.
