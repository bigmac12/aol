pine tree healthy~
   This large pine tree seems to be in full health, its needles are are a full
vibrant green.  It grants a fair amount of shade to travellers on the road who
might need it.  Some old faded carvings can be seen on the trunk.

tokin black~
   This small black tokin seems to be in good shape, and is adorned around the
edges with a copper design.  Though a bit antiquated, it is still very useful.
Shaped like a bowl, monks used these odd little items as a hat.  Once a parched
monk stopped for a rest, or had reached his destination, his tokin doubled as
his drinking cup.  (quite often to enjoy a spirit or two!  )

disc onyx chain smooth~
   This smooth onyx disc is about the size of a copper piece, and hangs from a
fine silver chain.  The front is completely free of markings, and is as smooth
as silk.  Holding the pendant in one's hand reveals a tingling sensation, and
the stone is strangely cool to the touch.  On the back, inscribed in the script
known as Magius which only Magi may read are the words, '&KNuitari Empowers&n'.
