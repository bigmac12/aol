frozen corpse elf~
   The corpse lies frozen onto the road and partially buried by a snow
drift.  It has been stripped completely naked and its eyes bulge out of
its head, the tissue expanding as it froze.  There are large sections of
the back of its legs missing, likely taken by companions for food to get
through this deadly section of mountain.
