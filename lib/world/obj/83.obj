tunic soft suede animal bones~
   Crafted from the skin of an animal, possibly a deer by the looks of it, this
tunic has been carefully cured and treated into suede.  The top third of the
tunic has been dyed forest green, the middle of the same color with stripes of
light green, the bottom fading through shades of light brown to dark earth
tones at the hem.  Small bones of an animal, one could assume the same that the
skin was taken from, have been tied by sinew vertically down the front and back
of this tunic to add extra protection.  The sleeves have been embroidered with
images of sacred spirit animals.
