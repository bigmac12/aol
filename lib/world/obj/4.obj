flamberge ancient platinum~
   The steel blade of this exquisite weapon curves like a serpent getting ready
to strike.  Its surface was etched long ago with runes of protection.  The
platinum-gilded hilt forms the shape of a dragon's claw and perfectly balances
the weight of its mighty blade.

Several magical runes have been carved into its seemingly delicate surface.  
Despite its delicate appearance, however, the staff hums with a magical force
that would seem to indicate its power.

It is engraved beautifully with a depiction of a twisting sea serpent crashing
through rocks and waves.  The edges of the armor are embossed with polished
copper, and it is padded on the inside with red velvet.  A fine piece of armor,
no doubt one-of-a-kind on this world.

longsword steel steel-bladed pearl pearl-inlaid inlaid hilt~
   This exquisite blade is made of high-quality Solamnic steel which has been
tempered and sharpened to a deadly edge.  Its blade is unadorned, though the
same cannot be said for its hilt.  The beautiful hilt is black, with pearls
inlaid into the pommel.  It is a rather light weapon, and can be swung very
easily.  When it is held though, you feel just a little weaker, though the
sword glows even more brightly, as if it were somehow feeding on your energy.

   Three massive, spiked balls forged from the finest steel hang from sturdy
chains.  Each ball weighs nearly four pounds and could deliver a crushing blow
on its own.  The balls are secured to a hardwood pole which is just over two
feet in length.  The pole has been wrapped with strips of leather to provide a
better grip.

acsemthani elven pear wood ancient bow shortbow~
   This shortbow, or halfbow as it is often called, is about half the height of
the elven archers it was intended for.  Nearly three feet in length, this
ancient bow is demonstrative of the unsurpassed craftsmanship of the elven
people.  It is made from the tough, yet springy, wood of a pear tree.  This
stiff, straight-grained wood is ideal for bow making.  The bow string is made
from flax rather than the typical cow sinew.  Flax makes for a thinner yet
stronger string and is typical of elven bows.

   The runes that ornament this garment appear to be from a language long since
forgotten.  Despite its apparent age, the robes are still in excellent
condition.  The silk is as smooth and luxurious as any you have ever seen.  
The workmanship is beyond compare, as well, indicating that these robes were
fashioned for someone of great import.

staff magius~
   Magius was a wizard of legend who aided Huma in his quests.  His staff is
one of the most revered artifacts, not for its powers, but in honor of the mage
who used it.  Indeed, compared to other devices, it seems to be of little use.
But many have suspected that there was more magic to the staff than met the
eye.
