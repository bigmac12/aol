   A strange feather appeared at my door.  It was warm to the touch and it
seemed to be glowing a golden brown.  I am by far not a holy man.  This has
been a message from the Gods.  It has to be.  When I held the feather to the
flame of my candle it glowed brightly and then burst into flame sending a fine
smelling smoke into the air.  I panicked and tried to hide the smell.

house.  My tongue was held and my throat wend dry then it spoke.  " Human, I
Allonium, speaker of my kind has been sent to warn you.  In two years from this
day your town will be laid to ashes by an army.  Your only hope is to raise my
child and pronounce it your leader and God.  If you fail to do so, death will
claim you all".  With that being said, he dropped a solid gold egg to the
ground and kissed it.  As he kissed it, the egg momentarily blazed with a dark
red flame.  Then he spoke again " Create a church dedicated to him, and in the
basement of this room, this will be his nest for him to grow strong, take my
feathers and create a heating system, with this system it will provide
sufficient heat to keep my child alive, I repeat, this is your only hope"

dropped off to be our savior.  We did as we were ordered.  Underneath the
church a chamber was built.  It was constructed to provided enough heat to
sustain the phoenix after it hatched.  My only fear is that he would not grow
it time.  Then finally it happened!  The egg cracked and out came a wondrous
bird.  A bird of legend.  A bird of flame.  Its wings barely reached out past
two feet long.  Their soft feathers were surrounded by a soft glowing flame.  
It eyes shined with great wisdom and understanding.  It claws looked both
powerful and fragile at the same time.  It spoke in a broken form of common
when it chose to.  I was breathtaken, this creature at birth knows how to speak
and its destiny has been foretold.

   The sun chamber seems to be the strangest of them.  Its purpose represents
the home of this legendary bird of fire.  The room though pulsates with heat
energy.  The walls seem to move and fluxate with each blinking of my eye.  
Strangely, when I reach out to feel the heat it's not present, in fact all
appears to be a mirage to sustain the phoenix growth.  Now the sun child is a
scary creature.  Its skin has been charred and it also pulsates with heat and
fire.  It burns by eyes to look at this manifestation of a simple child we
created.

   This strange chamber represents the sleeping stage of the phoenix.  After
the egg has hatched and the infant phoenix is placed into proper custody.  I
had to make sure it spent at least six hours under the moonlight.  The reasons
for this I don not know.  The upper level of the moon chamber has large glass
to magnify the intensity of the moonlight, there fore speeding up the growth
rate of the phoenix.  Is the wrong?  The guardian of this chamber is a blue
skilled elf, who has been chosen by the Phoenix elders of the village.  The
process to choose the elf is simple.  The same process in making an elf, a dark
elf.

   The procedure or rather implantations of needed torture are as the follows:
First the victim is dowsed into a think layer of inflammable liquid.  This is
applied carefully with the feathers of the phoenix, which is destroyed after
use.  Then this liquid is set to dry, by placing the victim in a small room,
known as the Chamber of Fire.  This room is always kept at a very high degree
so the liquid doesn't not melt away causing the victim to incarnated.  The
third and final process of the bathing of flames requires the room to be
encased in extremely hot flames and the liquid is there replaces the victims
skin, making him the lord of the flame.

Chapter One:  Chamber of Fire

   This is the first of the four rooms that crafted is the Chamber of the sun.
This chamber was to honor the Phoenix and its living flame.  The two rulers or
this room were selected by there dedication to the church.  There represent the
Peaceful and Kind Side of the Phoenix: The Lord of the Flame.  The process to
create the Lord of the flame as instructed by the Phoenix appears to be quite
painful procedure.  One that myself could not endure.  To read more on this
procedure: Read Second Chapter: The Bathing of Flames

   This beautifully crafted sapphire and gold earring seems to be made of the
same sapphire that brings life to a marble golem.  The base of the earring is
in the shape of tiny leaves that float around in a circle.  The sapphire rests
in the center of the leaves.
