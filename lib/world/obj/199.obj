bed~
   As you look at the bed and it's soaring canopy, you realize it glows
slightly.  The canopy peaks about 10 feet off of ground level and has a crimson
silk covering over it, filtering all light that goes through it, and turning it
crimson.  The headboard is black, and the foot board is a deep crimson.  Two
poles holding the canopy up are crimson, while the other two are black.    
~
E
sheets~
   The sheets that cover the bed are a deep black, and seem to absorb light,
while over the sheets lies a crimson comforter.  Both, sheets and comforter are
made of the most elegant silk you have ever seen.  The pillows are covered in
black crimson swirled, silk pillow covers, and the skirt around the bottom of
the bed is decorated on one side as black and the other crimson.  The material
that makes up the sheets and skirt are both very fine, elegant, and expensive
looking.
