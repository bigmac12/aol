cloak volumous voluminous cowled~
   This cloak is very thick, long, and large.  It is made of linen, and
brocaded with fancy swirling patterns.  The cloak is predominantly dark blue,
with black relief where the brocade is.  Inside the lining of the cloak are
numerous pouches and compartments, wherein many things may be stored.  The
cloak is very heavy, and would offer a great deal of protection from the
elements.  The cloth swirls and waves around the wearer's body.
