   The dragon's neck is held up by the Huma actor.  The body and the wings are
supported by a person in the body of the fake silver dragon.  Huma is over the
neck of the dragon, his legs touching the ground.  This dragon is nowhere as
big as the legends say dragons were.  Most of the dragon is made out of a light
wood frame covered in thin cloth.  Where the stomach of the dragon would be is
a large hole so the actor can get in and out.

costume silver dragon~
   The costume is not the greatest quality, but it does get the job done.  The
head of the dragon is wooden and painted.  The body, neck, wings, and tail are
made out of a light weight wooden frame covered tightly by silver colored
cloth.  At the base of the neck there is no wooden frame, making it look like
the dragon has a broken neck while it lies on the ground.  The lack of wood is
where the Huma actor 'rides', without the wooden frame being there he can run
across the ground instead of actually riding the dragon.  Half way up the neck
is a small handle cut out of the mane, this is held on to by "Huma" to keep the
neck from dragging on the ground.

   This costume isn't very good looking close up, but from far away, it looks
like a miniature version of the five heads of Takhisis.  Each head is a
different color, red, blue, white, black, and green.  The costume is a little
wider than an average human's shoulders.  The middle head has a hole cut out of
its neck so the wearer can see out of it.  Under the heads are large shoulder
pads and a few leather straps that can be tied to keep it from falling off.  
The costume is made out of thin leather wrapped around a light wooden frame.

   This is an overly ornate piece of armor.  On the each of the shoulders is a
large plate that has been shaped into the symbols of the knights, a rose, a
sword, and a crown.  On the center of the breastplate, over the chest, is a
large dragon, its wings are not fully attached to the armor and stick out a
little.  The clasps to keep the breastplate and backplate together are
decorative as well, each one of them a large metal rose.  The armor is very
light weight, it is so thin that it doesn't seem like it could stop a dull
knife.

cookie honey spice~
   Due to the high price of sugar in the current economy, honey has been used
to sweeten this treat.  Finely ground white flour is combined with a selection
of tempting spices and the honey to make a special treat for the tastebuds.  
The aroma of the spices is quite inviting.  The cookies are shaped like small
scallop shells and are a warm shade of honey brown.

   This round loaf of bread is one of many that is made each day to feed the
masses of Istar.  The loaves are baked off fresh each morning from sourdough
which has been sitting out for days in order to attract yeasts.  Each day some
of the dough is left unbaked to be used in the next day's batch.  This
particular loaf has been flavored with raisins and currants.

hood crimson stitched designs gold red~
   This hood is of the finest quality, yet seems to be a practical item for
outdoor use.  It is cut from a fine red cloth, and has been stitched with a
fine golden thread, making a beautiful knotwork pattern that traces the edges
of the hood.  Strangely, it seems to exude just the slightest amount of warmth.

The Three Foundations of Wizardry

1.  All wizards are brothers in their order.  All orders are
brothers in the power.

2.  The places of High Wizardry are held in common among
all orders and no sorcery is to be used there in anger against
fellow wizards.

3.  The world beyond the walls of the towers may bring brother
against brother and order against order, but such is the way of the
universe.
