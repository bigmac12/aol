carvings~
   The carvings on the trunk of this old oak have mostly faded, or been chipped
away with time.  Upon closer inspection, you see that what is left is carved in
common.  The only words that can be made out are 'spirits' and 'monk'.

oak tree ancient~
   This ancient oak tree is massive, the canopy of it's branches leaning over
the road to provide cool shade to any travellers passing through.  It looks as
though someone has made carvings in the bark on the trunk of the old tree,
though you'd have to look closer to see exactly what they are.

mask jeweled black leather mask vibrant raven ravens' feather plumage~
   This mask is masterfully crafted into the visage of a Raven, for which it
takes its name.  The materials used in its creation are undeterminable,
although it appears that real Ravens feathers have been used for the plumage.
If one examines the inside of the mask, they'll find small writing in a
beautiful spidery language, apparently now long forgotten.
