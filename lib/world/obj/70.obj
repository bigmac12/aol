a broken down wagon~
A large wagon lies here on its side, its wheels broken and the cloth sides torn.~
   This was a rather large wagon, and housed a fair amount of goods from what
can be seen of the wreckage.  The torn cltoh sides used to be gaily striped,
but are now covered with mud.  The wheels are also broken, and other pieces of
wood, most likely from crates that were in the wagon, lies splintered on the
ground nearby.

   These little mints, true to their name, are supposed to make who ever eats
them astonished.  Astonished at anything they see, or hear, even perhaps what
they themselves say or do.  Who knows how these tasty little treats work,
perhaps they're magicked!  Thus, if you consume them, you should RP accordingly
and weird out fellow players.  It'll be fun!

mints astonish tin~
   This small tin bears a faded paper label on the lid which reads,
"&WAstonish-Mints&n".  Taking off the lid you find several small, normal
looking mints set in wax paper.  They smell delicious however, strangely
remeniscent of your favorite confectionary.

known as Magius which only Magi may read are the words, '&WSolin Protects&n'.

hoopak ironwood designs~
   The hoopak is the most common of kender tools.  This 5' ironwood staff has a
short steel spike attached to its tip, which lets the hoopak double as a spear
or bo stick.  The staff's other end is forked and laced with gut.  A stone may
be flung by either planting the blade end of the hoopak in the earth and
bending the staff back to sling the stone, or whirling the hoopak overhead as a
traditional sling-staff.  It also acts as a bullroar when whirled in the air,
creating a low thrumming sound.  Intricate carvings of animals, places, items,
and many other things adorn the shaft of this hoopak.
