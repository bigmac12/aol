helm fierce fierce-looking helmet great adorned curving ram ram's horns~
   This is what could be termed a "Great helm".  It is designed to protect the
head entirely, as well as the shoulders.  It is also equipped with a built-in
visor which has affixed to it a full, red-feather plume.  The helmet is made of
tempered steel, made to deflect almost any sort of blow that should hit the
wearer.  Most noticeable of all are the two, great golden horns, shaped like
those of a ram, attached to the forehead of the helm.  The inside is lined with
a velvety lining that cushions the helmet and provides comfort.

engravings depicting strength, honour, and above all, in the center, a
double-bladed battle axe with bison's horns, the symbol of Kiri-Jolith.  It has
been warded so that none of a dark nature may even tough it lest their hands be
burned by the holy wrath of the Sword of Justice.  It does not look to have
been worn often, and the previous owner must have maintained it and oiled it
religiously.  It shines brightly in the sun.

cuffs, but there is no trace of embroidery.  Acolytes of Kiri-Jolith must first
learn the lesson of humility.  These robes fall to just below the knees and are
made with a square collar.  They are quite rough to the touch, and are not made
to be worn along without some sort of finer cloth underneath.

harm the unprotected body, thus this armor suits the task nicely.  It has
straps that fit over the shoulders and around the waist, that can be tied to

hammer heavy mason's~
   This immense hammer was never intended as a weapon of war, though it could
certainly serve as such if times demanded.  It is made of a great twenty-kilo
iron head fixed to a four foot oak shaft.  It is heavy and clumsy to use, but
it wasn't intended for finesse.  It is a tool that is used by masons to shatter
rocks for stonecutting.  It must be swung with both hands.  Its shaft is thick
and sturdy, for there is nothing a mason hates more than to break his hammer.

   This weapon is comprised of three main parts.  The first is the handle,
which is made of mighty redwood, and covered with patterns carved into it of
various items of holy significance.  The second is the chain, which is made of
strong steel links.  Attached to the chain is a massive steel ball, easily 20
pounds in weight, covered with spiked steel studs to increase damage.  One must
be careful when using this weapon, for in untrained hands, it can be as deadly
to the user as it is to the intended victim.

of the Crusaders known collectively as the Fist of Justice, an order embodying
devotion to Kiri-Jolith.  The shield is painted red with white crossing
stripes, and emblazoned over all of that is the symbol of a bison's head.  It
has a thick leather strap on the back that permits it to be slung over one arm,
though the weight and size of the shield makes it impossible for one to use

   The subject of so many tales that it has become legendary, the Holy Avenger
is the pinnacle of weaponry that a paladin can ever hope to attain.  Its
craftsmanship is beyond exquisite, it has been forged in divine fires, and is
reputed to have been blessed by Kiri-Jolith himself.  It is also said that a
warrior who wields the sword, if his heart be true, shall always strike true.
No evil being may touch the sword, and it instills awe in all who behold it.  
Its hilt is crafted of spiralling gold and platinum, and appears to be fragile,
but any who grip the sword know that they are holding a sword that will never
break under a thousand blows, nor bend, nor tarnish.  It is, in essence, the
perfect weapon.

shaped like a "T".  The visor cannot be lifted, instead, the helm must be
removed to get a better look.  There is some brass trim on the base of the helm
and around the eyepiece, and crowning it is a plume of red-dyed feathers that
rises up and tumbles down the back of the helm.  It is lined with fabric on the
inside, and looks like it would offer an enviable amount of protection.

sharp steel spikes, as well as an eight-foot chain.  It can be just as
dangerous at times to the one who wields it as the one who it is being wielded
against.  It takes a strong and nimble warrior to be able to use it properly,
as well as enough space to be able to swing it.  However, on a successful hit,
it can do a horrid amount of damage, particularly on the unarmored victim.  It
does a fair job of piercing armor as well.  This is not the sort of weapon you
would expect to find in regular armed forces, but rather on berzerkers or
gladiators.

bannock bread sweet piece stick~
   Bannock was discovered first by plainsmen as a quick, easy-to-make bread.  
The dough is normally sweetened with honey or sugar, and is cooked in a most
peculiar method.  It is wrapped around the end of a sawed-off branch or stick
and cooked over an open flame.  It is very delicious, and as such has found its
way even among civilized peoples.  This bannock looks well-prepared and smells
simply delicious.

egg~
   This egg is standard sized, for a chicken, perhaps a little smaller.  Its
shell is mostly white, with brown dots upon it.  If fried up and eaten, this
egg would make a tasty little meal in itself, though it is a well-known ritual
among warriors to eat them raw during training.

chicken whole roasted spit roasting~
   This is a very large bird, as chickens go, or was anyway, until it was
slaughtered to feed people.  Its body is impaled on a slowly turning
rotisserie, and is spiced lightly.  It is approaching done-ness, and fills the
air with an intoxicating fragrance.  The chicken could likely serve as a meal
for a small family, with plenty of leftovers.

   This sack contains a variety of grains, mostly rough prairie wheat and oats.
In the hands of a compotent baker, it could be made into a few nice loaves of
bread.  To the impatient, it could be eaten on its own, though only the truly
indescriminating diner would make this into a meal.  It is contained in a good
quality burlap sack, and tied shut with a piece of twine.

dummy wooden sparring~
   This wooden dummy is approximately the size of a large man, equipped with a
battered shield and a dull spear.  It is mounted with a thick spring onto a
heavy stone base.  It is meant to be used for practicing maneuvers, though as
any warrior will tell you, there is no substitute for the real thing.  This
dummy must have at one time been polished and lacquered, but continuous use has
removed most of the finish.  It is still quite useful, and is obviously still
finding employment here.  As one of the training warriors takes a practice
bash, it springs back and forth violently, knocking the attacker on her behind.
Perhaps it isn't so harmless after all...

   This little box, about two feet cubed, appears to be a little house, which
is more or less what it is.  Topping it is a golden pyramid shape, and a little
door opens to the inside.  It is draped in red velvet to keep it safe and
covered from the eyes of laymen.  Inside is kept the holy of holies, the holy
words of the prophets, written since men have walked the earth.  It is the most
holy possession of the people of the fortress, and thus it is the most
well-protected item as well.

crackling fire pit.  The nights at the fortress get very cold indeed, so during
the hours where the sun isn't shining, it becomes a popular gathering place.  
During the day, it is not as popular, as the sun provides ample warmth on its
own, but even then, you can still find people sitting around it and chatting
amongst themselves.

the burden it bears.  It is loaded down with many many volumes of books and
tomes, of many different descriptions.  Some old, some newer.  Some in good
condition, some bad.  Some whose covers you can immediately decipher, some
written in strange and arcane languages.  Whoever these belong to, he is a very

   This beautiful medallion hangs on a thick, steel chain from around the
wearer's neck.  It is shaped like a double-headed battleaxe, and appears simple
enough, but when one looks closer at its gold surface, one sees intricate
carved patterns, representing all forms that the god, Kiri-Jolith is known to
take.  It glows softly with a holy light, and when worn by the correct soul, it
glows even brighter, bestowing that soul with increased health and a sense of
well-being.
