twisted short shortstaff staff~
   The staff is of fine craftmanship.  It is very delicately twisted but
retains the strength of a solid staff.  As it is rather short, it enhances the
control the wielder of this weapon has on it.

   A small blue sphere floats above the ground here.  Approaching it you can
get a closer glimpse, though it is nearly impossible to catch the constantly
spiralling stone.  It is smooth, shiny, and semi-transparent, purest azure blue
in color.  It glows softly, and within it you get a sense of things hidden and
obscured, exposed by the holy light which surrounds it.
