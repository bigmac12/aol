E
dagger masterwork adamantite nacred wing-shaped cross guard~
   Perfect.  No other word can accurately describe the quality of this weapon;
any other descriptor would serve only to demean the sheer flawlessness that is
this piece of work.  The blade is clean, polished, and eight inches in length.
Where it meets the hilt of the weapon, a pair of wings flair outward and taper
gradually toward the blade at the tips, forming the cross guard.  The entire
back half of the weapon is carved from a rare breed of vallenwood and coated
entirely with nacre, giving it an iridescent sheen in the light.  A stamp is
visible on the metal where the blade meets the hilt.

E
skull beautifully faceted murky yellow tourmaline~
   Crafted by the hands of a master jeweler, this skull sits comfortably in the
palm of an average human hand.  It has been painstakingly faceted with such
precision that only a true master could have created this miracle of
tourmaline.  Each eye socket is set with an oval-cut ruby of amazing clarity
and quality.  The upper and lower jaw of the skull has embedded in it nearly
thirty white spinel gems.  The teeth are not made clear, but deliberately left
with their stress lines on display.  The top of the skull is hinged, though it
is not obvious how - some proprietary knowledge was used to hide it completely.

shell tiny turbinella hung black leather strap~
   Tiny indeed, this turbinella shell is rather beautiful.  Soft pale pink can
be seen inside the shell, but the detailed outer designed made by whatever
sea-creature is truly an artist.  Each swirl of the shell is a different shade
of pink, until at the very tip of the spiral shaped shell a tiny pea-size pearl
seemly has grown out of it.  It has been artfully hung on a black leather strap
about eight inches in length.
