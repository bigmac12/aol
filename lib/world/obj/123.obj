Urgrosh axe dwarven masterfully steel~
   A dwarven Urgrosh is a double weapon.  It serves as a typical dwarven
war-axe, as well as a spear.  This particular Urgrosh has been masterfully
crafted from steel by dwarven weaponsmiths.  It bears a viciously sharp war-axe
head, and on the butt end is a extremely sharp spear point.  Intricate
scrollwork graces the outside curve of the axes blade.  Dwarven warriors use
these weapons to great effect.

lightweight rapier glowing mithril blade~
   This extremely light rapier is made of the strongest mithril.  As you grasp
it, it hums slightly in a sort of hostile manner, whatever you can fathom is
that it was created for a certain owner.  Several large blue feathers are
attached to the pommel of the white, leather-wrapped wooden hilt.  While the
bird looks rare, its feathers glimmer with a brilliance all their own.  
Judging by the detail and overall beauty, one would guess that it was made by
dwarves.  As opposed to the typical dwarve works, this blade appears to be of a
certain humble quality, perhaps made to caputre the personality of the intended
wielder.  Etched onto the wood of the hilt are several words wrriten in the
dwarven script.

chainmail chain dwarven chain-mail mail steel shirt~
   This is a hauberk style tunic of chainmail, falling to just above the knees
with sleeves to the elbows.  It is fitted for those of the dwarven race, and
from the looks of the craftmanship likely forged by them as well.  The armor
itself is composed of thicker, heavier steel links than regular chainmail thus
making the armour a bit heavier than normal.  However, due to the thickness of
the links, it is also much harder to damage or pierce.

whip hard ancient engraved~
   To the untrained, this weapon resembles a training sword or a club.  To
monks, and those with training in martial weaponry, this weapon is known as a
hard whip, or a 'whip stick'.  It is roughly two feet in length, and made from
brass with a solid steel core.  This makes for a rather heavy weapon, though
wielding it reveals that it has been expertly balanced somehow.  The blade of
the whip is square, and bears circular 'knots' all along the length, one about
every inch.  These knots are designed to help catch an opponents blade and turn
it.  Writing has been engraved into each of the knots along the blade, though
the only one which might still be readable is the very last, which reads
"Thunder".  The hilt of the weapon has been crafted to look like the head of a
dragon, with the blade extending from its mouth.  The grip is made of rosewood,
and has been wrapped with leather to provide a better grasp on the weapon.  
The weight and solidity of this weapon makes it devastating when wielded by the
right hands, and is capable of being used like a sword, or like a mace.  A
'whip stick' is often used in pairs.

  - &RReorx the Forge, and Dwarven Beliefs&n -

     Mighty &RReorx&n is the one and only true dwarven god. He is represented
 as living deep underground, and in Thorbardin is worshipped in the form of
 shafts drilled down into the earth. This is merely a metaphor, however,
 that &RReorx&n is in fact deep inside every dwarf. The hammer, representing
 &RReorx's&n creative power, is also an important symbol for dwarves. All
 dwarves worship &RReorx&n in one form or another, and consider all other
 gods to be misdirection.

 &RReorx's Symbols:&n Forging Hammer, Dwarven Hammer, Anvil
 &RReorx's Colors:&n Slate Grey, &RRed&n
 &RReorx's Constellation:&n A glowing &Rred star&n, located near the
                        constellation of Sargonax

   &RWhere did the world come from?&n

     Mighty &RReorx&n tamed Chaos to forge the world upon his anvil. As he struck
 the forging blows the world slowed and time began. The stars are the sparks
 thrown into the heavens by his hammer.

   &RWhere did I come from?&n

     We were made as &RReorx's&n special children. He allowed other races to
 populate the world, but we remained hidden beneath the mountains until such a
 time as &RReorx&n decreed that we should go forth and help the other races.
     When dragons roamed the skies and all looked bleak for the world, that
 is when &RReorx&n saw the need for strong, brave warriors and that is when
 dwarves first walked the face of Krynn.

   &RWhy do we die?&n

     Nothing lasts forever - even stone wears away over time. That is the way
 &RReorx&n made things and we must not question it. However, there are evil
 forces in the world, set free by the other races, that can make things wear
 out faster than &RReorx&n intended. They are the powers behind rust, illness,
 metal fatigue and so on.

 (cont'd, look page3)
~
E
page3~
   &RWhat happens after we die?

     &nAfter we die our bodies are taken to the Valley of the Thanes
 to be lain in state. Your soul will go to &RReorx&n where He tends his
 forge. There you may work and rest as you please, and drink ale in the cool
 caverns of His home.

   &RHow do I work magic and recite prayer?&n

     When you build something, if you approach the task with a clean mind and
 clean hands, with purity of purpose, then you may sometimes reflect a tiny
 portion of the magic that &RReorx&n did when he created the world, and what you
 make will be special in some way. Maybe it will never break, under any
 circumstance. Maybe it is twice as effective at whatever it is supposed to do,
 perhaps someone using it will never tire. Also, if you are a good dwarf,
 sometimes your prayers to &RReorx&n may be answered, but this is never in the way
 we expect.
     Once long ago, the Sorcerers taught us their magic in exchange for
 craft knowledge. This turned out to be a bad deal on our behalf, because we
 cannot use their magic without dire consequences. When used by dwarves, the
 magic of the moons twists their minds and bodies. The Theiwar and the Daergar
 show you what can happen to a dwarf who uses lunar sorcery. They are no
 longer true dwarves, they are now more "derro" - the degenerate ones.

of silver, and polished to a high shine.  The metal is unmarred, lacking
engravings or other markings.  Set into the flask however, are four deep red
spinels.  The spinels are triangular in shape, and have been set into the front
of the flask in a square pattern, spaced evenly apart.  This leaves a silver
'X' pattern showing inbetween the stones themselves.  The contrast of silver
against the deep red of the spinels creates a stunning effect.

the expertise can tell them apart, however.  Garnets are generally darker in
color, though this makes them no less valuable.  In some areas, garnets are
actually more desirable.  The dwarves highly value the garnet, and even have a
settlement in the mountains named for this gem.

device on, using a large red button at its presumable head, it whirs into
action, screaming as steam is released.  The cylindrical portion of the device
shakes violently, and the chisel on the end begins to bob up and down.  
Anything it comes into contact with is quickly chewed into bits.
