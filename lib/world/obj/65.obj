mantle heavy ivory pauldrons swathed cloth~
   This mantle has a truly unique design, found only among the Khurnish
plainsmen.  It has been designed with practicality as well as aesthetics in
mind, and is truly the work of a master craftsman.  The mantle consists of
ivory plates, beautifully carved and crafted into the shape of pauldrons.  The
plainsmen of Khur use ivory for its beauty, as well as its sturdiness and
excellent resistance to heat.  Thick, ivory-colored cloth has been swathed over
the pauldrons, and attached via tiny silver pins.  When worn, the cloth would
almost appear as an oversized collar of sorts.  The purpose of this is twofold;
to provide warmth on chill desert nights, as well as being used to shield one's
mouth and neck from the desert sands.  The fabric used is porous, allowing heat
to escape but keeping out the wind.  The plainsmen often combine these mantles
with a volumous, ivory-colored cloak of the same fabric.

and sands.

Simply put it is a dagger, but what sets it apart from other daggers is its
design.  Most Khurnish daggers are created with blades of damascus, chosen for
its excellent ability to slice and cut.  This weapon is no exception, and bears
an extremly sharp damascus blade.  The hilt has been crafted from regular
steel, and is curved and forged in the shape of a horse's head.  The steel is
inlaid with silver, accentuating the animal's features.  The Khurnish symbol
for wind has been inlaid in silver upon the blade as well.

recognize these markings as the traditional tattoos used by the plainsmen of

OOC: This item once placed on a wear location, cannot be removed. Just as in
real life, once you put a tattoo on you can't take it off. Even an immortal
won't be able to remove this item from you. The only way to remove it is by
dying. (in any case, not very realistic for it to just 'disappear')

If you plan to use it, you need to wear using the specific location you want
it to be placed on. ie, 'wear tattoo arms', or 'wear tattoo wrist'. If you
don't specify, it will choose a spot for you.

The available locations are:

NECK HEAD LEGS HANDS ARMS WRIST ANKLE BACK SHOULDER FEET BODY FACE

When using these kinds of items, please use common sense. If you have hair,
don't wear it on your head. Females probably shouldn't wear it on the BODY,
since you can't wear anything else over it. Yes, it may be unrealistic, but
that's how the code works. It doesn't matter if you SHOULD be able to wear
and item over your tattoo, you just can't. :)

However, this is no ordinary aquamarine.  This is a teardrop aquamarine, a very
rare treasure.  It has not been cut in this shape, this stone was formed in the
shape of a tear naturally.  This type of aquamarine is what is known as a "Gods
Tear" or "Paladine's Tear", and is very, very valuable.  It is believed that
these stones are the solidified tears of the gods themselves.  More
specifically, it is believed that they are Paladine's tears, shed for his
children, those number of the metallic dragons that Takhisis corrupted in the
Age of Starbirth.  As such, not only are these stones of high value to
collectors, they are also highly prized among the clergy of both Takhisis and
Paladine, though for different reasons.  Whenever one of these rare stones is
found it is always in perfect condition and glitters with an inner light; only
serving to perpetuate the legends further.

grotesque corpse table~
   This corpse is still slightly warm, and yet looks as though it has been
rotting here for weeks or months even.  Judging by what is left the best you
can guess is that it was about 5 feet tall, beyond that nothing else can be
recognized as to race, or the person.
