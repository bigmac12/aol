ring silver runes inscribed~
   This small silver ring would look like any other, save for the spidery
language of magic inscribed into its surface.  Runes of power can also be seen
engraved amidst the writing, glowing with a faint light.  To most, this ring is
an umistakeable work of magic, though what powers it may hold are unknown.  
Those of magical inclination would perhaps be able to surmise the ring's true
powers, however.

scimitar steel engraved blade~
   This weapon is what is known as a scimitar; a longsword with a thin,
slightly curved blade.  It is a favored weapon among the elves, as well as less
reputable folk such as rogues, rangers, and skirmishers.  This scimitar has a
leather-wrapped pommel with a silver hilt.  The blade is made of steel, and has
been engraved with patterns depicting the wind.

decanter quartz suns heart sun~
   This decanter is crafted from clear rock quartz, normally an unusual
material for such a container.  However, the decanter was crafted by the hands
of Khurnish nomads.  Quartz is commonly found in the rocky areas of Khur, and
its excellent resistance to surface damage makes it ideal for this kind of use
in the desert.  It is filled with a vibrant gold wine, as golden as rays of the
sun from which it takes its name, Sun's Heart.  The wine is fragrant, bearing a
pleasant smelling spicy scent.  The drink itself is goes down smooth, but holds
a subtle spiciness to accompany its fragrant smell.

decanter crystal bloodwine lemish~
   This is a fine-quality crystal decanter, bereft of any decoration except for
a strange angular symbol engraved on the side.  Only the nomads of Lemish would
be able to discern its meaning.  The liquid inside is bright crimson and smells
quite strong, though not unpleasant.  It is a very rare wine (at least outside
of Lemish), and is rumored to be an aphrodisiac.  What the nomads of Lemish
call this drink is unknown, though amongst outsiders it is named 'Bloodwine'
for its color.  Perhaps another basis for such a naming are the whispered
rumors of Lemishian blood rituals.

cassock sturdy undecorated black~
   This cassock is made from a sturdy, dyed black wool.  It is a bit unlike a
traditional cassock, in that it is more like a robe than a cloak.  Indeed, the
only thing setting it apart from a robe is the way in which the garment closes,
as well as having a small, stiff collar.  This cassock is worn like a robe, but
instead of sliding it on over the head of the wearer, one would put this on
like a coat.  It closes at the chest by means of buttons hidden on the
underside.  A sash, or 'cincture' among the holy orders, is usually worn in
accompaniment to help secure it about the wearer.  The cassock fits snugly
about the body, falling to about ankle length where it flares out slightly.  
The sleeves of the garment are form-fitting as well, and likewise flare at the
ends.

rapier sleek steel silver hilt maidens song basket~
   The blade of this rapier is crafted of high grade steel, and is very sleek
in design.  It has been forged in such a way as to make it lightweight, and
remarkably flexible.  The image of a closed eye is stamped upon the blade
itself, close to the hilt.  The hilt is crafted completely of silver, and flows
beautifully into a basket-styled hand guard.  When used in combat the blade
emits a faint ringing sound; reminiscent of a young woman's voice carried upon
the wind.  Those who have seen or heard of this weapon have coined it,
"Maiden's Song", in honor of the strange but beautiful sound. Truly this sword
is the work of a master craftsman.
