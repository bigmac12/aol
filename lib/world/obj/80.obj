Age of Dreams

And from a Swirling Chaos, the gods Emerge.  Taking realms of chaos unto
Themselves, they establish the Balance of the Universe.  Chaos slows and is
subdued by the triumvirate of Good, Neutrality, and Evil.

The Universe is forged from Chaos.  Sparks fly from the Anvil, creating stars
in the sky.  Worlds are wrought by the hammer strokes and left to cool.  The
spirits of the races sing and dance among the stars.

The three realms vie for control of the sentient spirits.  The gods of Good
press to give the spirits power in physical worlds, nurturing them toward the
greater good.  The gods of Evil desire to subjugate the spirits as servile
beings.  The gods of Neutrality desire to free the spirits to their own
desires.

The war ends with an alliance between the good and neutral gods.  The spirits
will gain power in the physical world, yet will retain the freedom to choose
good or evil.

Krynn is populated.  Our world begins.

to put bums in seats.  It is made of tanned leather, fitted with shards of
metal to add to the damage that one can cause with a grappling attack.  Large
portions of the body, notably the stomach and breasts, are left largely
exposed, but not so much as to cause scandal.  Just enough to titillate the

gladiatorial pit, where show is more important than effectiveness, though it
could be pressed into service on the battle field as well.  There is a leather
cord attached to the butt end, so that it can be held onto when it is used for
