hole round gaping~
   Peering into the depths of the hole, you see nothing but impenetrable
darkness.  The shrill sounds seem louder now, rising to a scream as you peer
down into the former well, almost as if your presence is sensed and unwanted.
The edges of the chasm are soft and precarious, and it seems unwise to venture
any closer.

collar spiked~
   The width of a minotaur's thumb, this dark leather collar is cracked and
obviously worn.  A silver clasp, which is difficult to open, seals the loop
snuggly about the wearer's neck.  Sharp spikes that draw blood at improper
handling protrude at even intervals around the outside of the collar.
