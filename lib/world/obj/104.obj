altar black basalt~
   The altar is immense, easily ten feet wide by twenty feet high.  A set of
black stairs lead up to the altar's surface, narrowly ascending to the top.  
The front of the altar is carved with intricate bas-relief details, and the
sign of Sargonnas is etched with care into each of the four corners.  In the
center of the altar is an effigy of a black and red condor, its wings outspread
over the room and talons extended, painted red to symbolize the blood of His
victims.  The overall effect is imposing, making mortals realize their
insignificance compared to the might and majesty of this god.

nine leather cords, each tipped with a sharp metal point.  The weapon is light
and well-balanced, and fits easily into the palm of a hand.

   This is a black chalice, used in sacred rites for the priests and
priestesses of the god Sargonnas.  Runes and prayers are carved into the
chalice's edges, and it is permanently affixed to the altar on which it rests,
through arcane means.  It is filled with a crimson red liquid, probably the
blood of the many men and women sacrificed here to the Dark God of Vengeance.
