   The rushing waters of the Fallendro river are so clear that they might tempt
experienced swimmers as well as those just looking to take a refreshing dip.  
Their current, however, is rather unfriendly.  It is rumored that the river
took its name from a derivative of the warning, 'Don't fall and drown', which
was often called to those who stood to close to its fast-moving waters.

   Jaguars generally have yellow to reddish-brown fur with black rosettes,
which help them to blend with their surroundings.  These rosettes merge into
stripes at the legs and neck.  Judging by the yellowish fur, the jaguar that
once wore this skin roamed the open plains.  It has been cut in such a way that
it is possible to wear this skin about one's shoulders, or to use as a simple
blanket during chilly nights.
