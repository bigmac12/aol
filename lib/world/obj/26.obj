boulder~
   This boulder must be at least twenty feet across and over ten feet high.  
Put here when the gods created Krynn, the boulder was too big to move, so the
builders of the quarry simply worked around it, sometimes using it to shelter
them against the heat of the day.  Unfortunately, the boulder blocks your path
down the slope.  You will have to go around it.
