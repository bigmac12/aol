red stone~
   The stone is perfectly smooth, and is slightly warm to the touch.  It sits
quietly, yet to those sensitive to the power of magic, radiates an incredibly
powerful hum of power.  This stone is the deep red of Lunitari's moon, a

corpse~
   The corpse is that of a tall and slender woman, her black hair long and
straight, and her eyes a pale blue.  However, the expression within their
depths is one of an unspeakable, wordless terror that continues to haunt from
beyond the grave.  Her fingers are clutched convulsively around a silver dragon
amulet, though both her feet and ankles are bound with silver chains of some
arcane means.  Her mouth is open in a silent, timeless scream of terror and
fear.

sword gems hilt rusted quest~
   This sword's blade is completely coated in a thick layer of rust, making it
fragile and ugly.  Part of it seems to have broken off already, the blade about
as long as a man's forearm.  The hilt is very much unlike the blade though.  
Made from gold, there is no rust on it.  Set into the gold are many gems of
different colors.
