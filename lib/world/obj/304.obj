corset ebony strapless~
   Fine steel boning lines the inside of this corset.  It is completely without
straps, and seemly risky to wear.  However, the side lacing keeps it firmly in
place against the womanly figure.  The top of the corset is scooped to show off
the woman's chest, and when worn it has a very flattering heart shape
appearance.
