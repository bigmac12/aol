suit catsuit black~
   This black, catsuit is crafted from supple leather that his been skillfully
sewn to provide a rather snug fit.  It is intended to cover most of the skin of
its wearer, however more often than not it seems to hide very little.  
Generally preferred by women, perhaps some of the most daring (and hopefully
petite) of men might be bold enough to wear such a garment.

tall green grasses and reeds grow around it.  All in all, this little area

been carved into its surface allowing for the convenient use of poison.
