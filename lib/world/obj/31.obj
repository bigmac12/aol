bush bramble berry~
   The thick branches of the bramble berry bush are covered with thorns which
can make harvesting a tricky business.  It is worth the effort, though, as the
berries possess a lovely taste which is both tart and sweet.  They are
delightful fresh off the bush and are also great for baking and for making a
sweet bramble berry wine which is quite popular in these parts.

   Though harvesting these berries is a bit of a challenge (what with all the
nasty thorns that grow on their gnarled branches), it is generally worth the
effort.  They are delightful fresh off the bush and are also great for baking
and for making a sweet bramble berry wine which is quite popular in these
parts.

scimitar blade~
   This is one of the most beautiful and well-crafted scimitars that you have
ever laid eyes upon.  Its blade is perfectly balanced, and the scimitar seems
to fit well to your hand.  The blade is polished to a shine and appears
razor-sharp.  The pommel of the sword is wrapped with a rich, dark brown suede,
and tooled with a leaf design.  A script in an unusual language runs along trhe
length of the blade on both sides, etched lightly into the surface.

E
script druidic writing~
   The script is etched lightly along the length of the blade, on both sides.
The script is in the Druidic tongue, and only those of the forest are known to
know this language.  For those who can read it, the text says, "Spirits of the
Forest, Defenders of the Wilds, Guide Thine Blade for Your Service".

pommel~
   The pommel of this blade is wrapped in a beautiful, rich brown suede
leather.  The leather has been tooled with a magnificent design of aspen
leaves, curling along the pommel's length.

gloves leather hunting elven design~
   The exquisite craftsmanship combined with the suppleness of the leather
clearly identify these gloves as the work of elves.  They are a earthy shade of
brown that would easily blend in with the hues of the forest.  Their design is
such that they would provide coverage for the fingers and hands while not
inhibiting their movement.  Designed to fit the slender hands of an elf, they
would be a poor fit for the larger races of Krynn.

earring tourmaline colorless stud~
   Though tourmaline can be found in nearly every color of the rainbow (and
some colors that are not in the rainbow!  ), this particular specimen is
completely colorless.  It tends to pick up the color of its surrounding, making
it a very versatile piece of jewelery.  It has been attached to a golden stud
to allow it to be worn as an earring.

wraps wrist golden yellow cloth~
   These strips of golden cloths are designed to be worn wrapped around the
wrist.  They provide a small bit of protection for the wearer's wrist, however
their primary purpose is decorative.  Such wrist wraps are a favorite of the
followers of Branchala who use them to accent their eye-catching ensembles.

staff redwood wood gleaming crystalline ornamentation~
   The shaft of this long, thick staff is made from the wood of a mighty
redwood tree, prized for its strength and durability.  The staff itself has
been carved with numerous runes, indicating that it is imbued with the power of
white magic.  The runes have been filled and ornamented with a strange
crystalline material, which also comprises the staff's crest: a glittering
crystalline hand, all fingers and thumb pointed upwards, looking like an oath
is being sworn.  Though the ornamentation appears fragile and looks like it
would break in combat, it is very strong, and will only break if the wielder
does.

basket willow woven~
   This willow basket has been skillfully made by elven crafters, no doubt.  
The willow itself has been dried and is a warm shade of honey.  It is large
enough to fit several loaves of bread or quite a bit of fruit.  A sturdy
over-handle allows it to be conveniently carried in hand or on your arm.
