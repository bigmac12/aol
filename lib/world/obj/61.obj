table small~
   This small table rests against the western wall of the room.  It is carved
from a solid piece of rosewood which has been ornamented with several different
runes.  The top of the table has been scorched black in a few places.  Perhaps
the markings are the result of some experiment.

sash ivory linen colored~
   This long white sash is made of the highest quality linen.  At either end,
it has been embroidered and fringed; laced with bits of silver thread.  It is
much longer than it is wide, and could be wrapped about all but the widest of
waists several times.
