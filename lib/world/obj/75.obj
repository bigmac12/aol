chest iron-bound sturdy~
   This dust-covered chest sits just underneath the stone bar.  It is made of
thick, strong wood and reinforced with iron to withstand even the mightiest
swing of an axe.  The lock upon it is likewise very sturdy, and appears very
complex, likely to foil the efforts of even the most accomplished of thieves.
It looks to have been closed for many years.  Helgrin, while resting, is in the
habit of putting his foot on it, 'Just in case,' as he tells it.

   This key is made of beautiful wrought-iron and appears to be of sturdy
dwarven craftsmanship.  Cryptic dwarven runes line the shaft, but they cannot
be easily read.

lantern glass wrought-iron edging~
   This lantern is, in essence, a small cannister of flammable oil with a wick.
It is contained by a glass sphere, held in place by wrought-iron edging.  The
iron is wonderfully shaped into swirling patterns, quite pleasing to the eye.
The glass is clear and allows the light to pass through nearly unrefracted.

Hammer warhammer glittering steel Thunderbolts Nzaalhir~
   Nzaalhir is famed in dwarven legend as the Hammer of Thunderbolts, or
Skyhammer.  Legend has it that in the long-lost glory days of the dwarves,
Reorx smiled upon them and gifted the greatest of their warriors with this
mighty hammer, that he would carry it into battle and bring Reorx's fury down
upon the enemies of the dwarves.  Those days have passed into legend, and the
hammer was lost to time, generally regarded as little more than a myth.  You
now hold it in your hands.  Nzaalhir is a very, very heavy hammer, made of a
mysterious, glittering, mithril-like ore.  Its stout handle is shaped to fit
perfectly into a stubby dwarven hand, and its head is elegantly shaped and
symmetrical, either side capable of delivering a devastating blow with either
head.  When one looks closely, one can see writing upon it, a different sort of
metal set seemlessly into the hammer's surface.  It bears a simple message:

       '&CHe who holdeth the mighty Nzaalhir is a dwarf among dwarves,
  Defender of Reorx's children, and chosen protector of the undermountain.&n'

Claw Kharasz glistening black evil~
   An evil artifact, ripped from the hand of a truly evil creature, the Claw of
Kharasz is glistening, black, and some two feet long from end to end.  The
entire length of it is beyond sharp.  It seems to cut through the very air
itself.  It is surrounded by an aura of intense evil, lingering long after the
death of its previous owner.  A demon's claw is more than just a weapon, it is
a symbol of the power of its possessor, and, it is rumoured, a tool by which a
powerful evil mage can summon other demons to perform his bidding.  Luckily for
the world, these are simply rumours, and a mage who wished to perform such an
evil ceremony would most certainly have to study long hours to even probe into
the dark secrets of the ritual.
