   This headdress is one of pure, exquisite craftsmanship.  The intricate

brow of true elven blood can this form of beauty be worn.  Made of the purest
of mithril coated silver brocade, and twisted into the minuscule details of
elven knots.  That work alone would make this circlet a beauty, however the
crafter has adorned detailed aspen leaves forged from century tarnished patina;
only to be further added with tiny gold acorns.

   To a well-trained Silvanesti warrior, the Silvanesti Battle Shield is an
invaluable piece of armour.  It looks much like a bracer and covers the arm
from wrist (including a plate over the top of the hand) to the elbow with a
raised portion that sweeps backward and extends off the arm in both directions
just over an inch.  With this style of shield, the hand is still free to bear
arms of any kind and the shield does not encumber or hamper movement.  
Silvanesti Battle Shields are usually worn in pairs, one on each arm.

with a spiral of vines graced by hundreds of perfectly carved leaves.  It has
clearly been treated with some sort of polish that provides a smooth and
lustrous surface.    

   Sitting atop the staff is a tin sphere that has been 'punched' with a sharp
implement in order to create hundreds of puncture holes in the surface of 
the metal.  The pattern of the holes is such that when viewed at night
it creates the effect of a golden light shimmering on a dark pond.  The
source of this light is dozens of fireflies who now call this sphere home.

bryony herb black bunch flowering vine purple berries~
   &gThe leaves of this plant are heart-shaped, smooth and shining as if they
had been varnished.  Late in autumn they turn dark purple, making a very showy
appearance.  In winter, the stems die down, though the root is perennial.  The
flowers are small, greenish-white, in loose bunches and of two kinds, barren
and fertile on different plants, the latter being succeeded by berries of a red
colour when ripe.  The large, fleshy root is black on the outside and
exceedingly acrid.  &n

&y(Rangers, Druids and Herbalists/Healers/Mages look also at USES)&n
~
E
Uses~
   The expressed juice of the fresh root, mixed with a little white wine, has
been used as a remedy for gravel, being a powerful diuretic.  Death in most
painful form is the result of an overdose, while the effect of a small
quantity, varying not with the age only, but according to the idiosyncrasies of
the patient, leaves little room for determining the limit between safety and
destruction.  The expressed juice of the root, with honey, has also been used
as a remedy for asthmatic complaints, but other remedies that are safer should
be preferred.  The berries act as an emetic, and children should be cautioned
against eating them.    
   As an external irritant, Black Bryony has, however, been used with
advantage. The scraped pulp is applied as a stimulating plaster, and in gout,
rheumatism and paralysis it has been found serviceable in many instances. A
tincture made from the root proves a most useful application to unbroken
chilblains, and also the fruits, steeped in gin, are used for the same
remedy. Black Bryony is a popular remedy for removing discoloration caused
by bruises and black eyes, etc. The fresh root is scraped to a pulp and
applied in the form of a poultice.

   This is an elegant little plant standing two to eight inches high, and

variegated with yellow.  The stem is erect and wiry, with many opposite
branches.  The leaves are about half an inch long, and a fourth an inch wide,
forming a somewhat lanced shaped.  The flowers, white, or lilac and
purpleveined, are in terminal spikes, with leafy bracts interspersed.  The
seeds in all kinds of the flowers are produced in tiny, flattened capsules, and
are numerous and ribbed.    

&y(Rangers, Druids and Herbalists/Healers/Mages look also at USES)&n
~
E
uses~
   Herbalists often use this herb and recommend its use in diseases of the
sight, weakness of the eyes, etc.  It is also rumored to improve the mental
faculties, strengthening and preserving one's memory.  The juice obtained by
expression from the eight drops of the herb to a pint of boiling water should
be used and the eyes bathed three or four times a day.  When there is much
pain, it is considered desirable to use a warm infusion rather more frequently
for inflamed eyes till the pain is removed.  In ordinary cases, the cold
application is found sufficient.    
   Eyebright is well known by the elves, whom often use it to create a
special Eyebright wine. Druids too, are well versed in its properties and
can often be found with salves created from the herb. It has even been used
in teas and ales in some areas.

it is roughly the size of a common dagger or gauche.  This particular sai is
crafted of steel, with a sharpened center prong.  The two shorter prongs have
been left dull, though could still cause grievous harm.  The pommel is crafted
of silver, and has been engraved with designs of twining vines and leaves.  A
strip of leather has been wrapped around the handle, providing a better grip.
A sai is often employed in pairs, using one to attack and the other to defend
or disarm one's opponent.    

&y(See ORIGIN for additional information)&n
~
E
ORIGIN~
   The origin of the Sai lies in farming, being used as an aid for planting
crops by hand.  The farmer would stick the prongs in the ground, creating three
evenly spaced holes.  They would then move further down the row, again creating
three evenly spaced holes beginning where the last set left off.  The holes
were then used to plant seeds, thus creating evenly spaced crops.  In later
usage, the Sai was given a secondary purpose: self-defense.  In times of war, a
Sai could be carried by any farmer without fear of having it confiscated,
because it was seen as a farming tool.  In turn, the farmers found it to be an
excellent weapon.  The design of the Sai lends itself to defending against
bladed attacks quite handily, being able to catch and turn a blade, or even
break it if the wielder has enough strength.  Generally, it is wielded in the
same fashion as a dagger, though certain monasteries have developed entire
styles of fighting with the Sai.

together and wrapped about the middle of the bow, providing a slightly padded
grip, thereby improving both comfort and accuracy.
