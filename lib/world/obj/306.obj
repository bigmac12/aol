river wide~
   This river while wide seems to be shallow along the banks, but deep enough
in the middle for narrow boats and barrages to sail.  Here and there large
rocks resting on the river bed are just barely visible beneath the gently
flowing current.  The current is slow enough here that it would be safe to swim
in, and enjoy fishing.
