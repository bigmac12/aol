yet still retaining a degree of flexibility.  The string of the bow is quite

   Crafted of a fine, dark wood, this flail is topped by seven wicked-looking
straps of leather.  Cut thin, yet still remarkably strong, each strand of
leather is set with seven silver studs.  Adding weight to the strands, the
small studs increase the force with which the strands lash a target and lend
the added strength of metal to the leather.

   Crafted from beautiful white marble, this fountain has been masterfully
sculpted to represent each of the patron deities of the Knights of Solamnia.  
A majestic dragon rises from the center of the fountain, it's outspread wings
nearly reaching the outer edges.  To the right, a powerful bison appears to paw
at the ground, and to the left, the image of a magnificent phoenix taking
flight.  The crystal clear waters contained within ripple melodiously, making
the area seem tranquil despite all of the surrounding activity.

complex-looking lock with the image of a dragon beside it.

triangle with the center filled with fine oak.

   Recessed into the southern wall of the coffers of Thelgaard is a large,
engraved storage locker.  It appears thick and well-crafted, yet it retains an
aire of elegance and a sense of the ornate.  It appears to glow slightly, as
though it were somehow warded or protected, charished by all that reside within
these halls.  Upon it's polished platinum surface is the image of the Knights
of Solamnia, the mark of the keep, crest of Solamnia itself, a proud kingfisher
with a beautiful rose.  Etched boldly into the metal beneath the engraving is
the solamnic phrase, "Est Sularus Oth Mithas," simply meaning "My Honor is my
Life," the Solamnic Knights ages old Oath.

pine tree ancient mountain~
   This ancient mountain pine stands tall, slightly away from the other old
pines in the area.  Its bark and needles look a bit dry, due to the lack of
much rain in this area.  It seems to have an aura of peace about it.  Old,
faded carvings can be seen in the trunk of the old pine, though one would have
to look very closely to be able to make anything out.

   Upon closer inspection, you see that the faded carvings are, or were,
actually words written in common.  Most are faded beyond recognition, but the
words 'spirits' and 'monk' can just be made out.

   This ancient staff is masterfully crafted in design, and practicality.  The
shaft of the staff is made of silver, and is engraved along the entire length
with beautiful, spidery script, now long forgotten.  The butt of the staff is
capped with a small copper piece, engraved with the symbol of a spider.  The
head of the staff is one solid piece of looped copper, from which hangs six
silver rings.  These rings make a beautiful crystalline sound when the staff is
used as a walking device, and serve as a clever tool to ensare an enemies
weapon in battle.
