fountain desecrated marble blood~
   This fountain was once elegant and beautiful, and rang with the sound of
cascading, crystal clear water.  In the temple's heyday, this water may have
been consecrated and blessed for travellers to drink before heading off on
their way.  Those days, however are long past.  The fountain is full of a thick
crimson liquid: blood.  The fountain has been desecrated, and painted with
profane, unholy patterns.  The paint cannot be removed, as it has been blighted
and cursed.  Something can barely be seen within the fountain's grisly depths,
though it is hard to tell what.

brazier golden~
   This is a beaten gold incense burner.  It is a medium-sized golden bowl,
chased with incricate figures of the gods of good, and decorated with tiny gems
and stones.  It has been overturned from its resting place on the wall and now
lies in a bashed-in heap on the floor, spilling incense onto the Temple's
floor.

incense ashes~
The incense is a fine, grayish colored ash that spills out from the 
overturned brazier.  It smells fragrant and slightly sweet, and was 
probably burned as some sort of religious offering to the gods of good.

   This bracer is exceedingly beautiful, and is in such pristine condition that
it might have been kept in storage for centuries.  It pulsates with an odd hum,
and when it is held, it is rather warm to the touch.  Considering its size and
apparent daintiness, it is rather heavy.  There seems to be some sort of
inscription on the inside of it.

statue rudely defaced sad old man~
   When the temple fell, every aspect of it was profaned, including this
statue.  It was perhaps once the likeness of the god Paladine, looking over the
temple with love and protecting those within.  Now the features of the statue
are twisted with sorrow for the fall of the temple.  The statue has been
crudely defaced and profaned, marked all over with black sigils and rude
etchings and forever ruining the beauty of the marble.  The statue is holding
something in a cupped hand.

necklace gold set large rubies~
   This necklace is made up of rather decent-sized gold box-links.  Spaced
evenly apart are rubies of varying sizes, the largest of these meant to be worn
near the front of the wearer.  Hanging from its apex is a very large ruby,
which is unusually translucent and clear.  If you look inside it, you can see a
shape, constantly changing, but reverting to the same thing over and over
again.  It is a single word, unlike any you have seen before:


                    &r"&RXIROKQUASH&r"&n

   It is impossible to distinguish what this is meant to mean, and nothing
about the necklace gives any clue.  There will have to be further study,
apparently...

cart large wooden~
   This cart has been built to last by a carpenter who really knew what he was
doing.  Its wheels could roll effortlessly over the roughest of terrain, and
the wooden sides are sturdy, built to support the heaviest of loads.  The front
of the cart has been affixed with tack and harnessed so that a pair of pack
animals could pull it along its intended course, but something is amiss.  
Despite the fact it is loaded down with heavy rocks and loose soil, it sits
here, abandoned.  Looking closer, you can see upon the tack and harness traces
of blood, and lodged underneath one wheel is a clean-picked bone from some
great beast.  Perhaps that is a clue as to why digging here was abandoned...

treated with utmost care if it is to survive.  It is long past repair.  It may
still be serviceable, though any sort of markings that would have given some
idea of what the key was meant to do have long since been worn away by age.
