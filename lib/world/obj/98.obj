   It's difficult to say what this mechanical monstrosity was designed for.  
In size, it is almost equivalent to three feet tall, wide, and deep.  It
appears to be tilted on its side - based on the fact that it has a set of eight
wheels facing the west, instead of being down on the ground.  The side opposite
the wheels appears to have been ripped apart from the inside by a tremendous
force.  There is no sign of the upper half of this contraption.

constantly wet with sea mist.  The bottom portion has a small metal cap over

   These boots have definitely seen better days.  They're make out of blackened
leather and were carefully, and lovingly, polished and shined to a perfection.
Then somebody bought them from the cobbler and used them hard.  The leather is
a bit cracked and folded in places, but they still serve the basic purpose of a
shoe: To protect your foot from being covered with blood when you kick
somebody.  Well, something like that.  A large metal buckle attacked to a pair
of straps keeps this boot from sliding off of your foot.

   Although this hat was once quite fancy, wear and tear has worn it down.  
From the top, this hat looks like an equilateral triangle, no one side larger
than the others.  A dome forms out of the center of the hat, providing the
perfect place to put one's head.  Especially if that person likes large hats.
The edges of the hat have a soft black leather covering them, preventing the
edges from fraying.

The only thing on them that stands out is their copper color, the color of
Majere, but even this doesn't stand out very much.  It's easy to imagine almost
anybody wearing these.  Farmers for their durability.  Monks for their
simplicity.  Citizens as something to throw on so they don't get arrested for
indecent exposure when they go about their daily chores.

   One would think that a purple shoe and an yellow shoe would never
purposefully be worn at the same time on one person unless it was a sort of
prank.  There are only three things these two shoes have in common.  One-
They're both largely made of cotton.  Two-They both are the same size.  Three-
They're both colors that most normal people would not like to see on their
feet.  Perhaps it was fate that brought these two shoes together.  The purple
shoe goes up to above your ankle when worn, and has a leather cord to tie it
together.  The yellow shoe is almost more of a slipper than a shoe.  It has no
ties or buckles, it just sort of fits over your feet, below your ankle.

turtle aquamarine sea green glowing zeblight~
   To anybody with any knowledge of the gods, this item is obviously an
artifact of Zeboim, the Goddess of the Sea.  She is known for her violent
temper, but she is also known to protect certain sailors.  Especially the ones
that offer her great sacrifices or amounts of money.  This artifact may have
been a gift to a sailor, for an especially big service to the Goddess.  It
glows with a constant teal colored light that illuminates a very large area.  
This could easily illuminate sharp rocks that may otherwise be hidden to a
sailor during the night.  The symbol itself is a fist sized turtle made out of
aquamarine.  The source of the light cannot be seen directly, but it does seem
to come from under the shell of the turtle.
