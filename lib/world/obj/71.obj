small cart~
   The little cart is made from old and dessicated wood held loosely together
with worn leather straps.  The donkey that pulls it looks as though it is on
its last legs, tired from the long journey to the city of Kalaman to deliver
the meagre goods.  The driver lightly whips the donkey and it begins to move
away towards the city.

cap jesters jester green gold checkered~
   This silly looking piece of headwear is what is known as a jester's cap, or
sometimes also as a fool's cap.  It is crafted from wool and felt, and is split
into four comically drooping 'tails', which are colored in bright, alternating
green and golds.  Small bells are attached to the ends of the tails, jingling
faintly with every movement of the wearer.

chainmail solamnic mail chain shirt master-crafted~
   Solamnic chainmail was created for those Knights of Solamnia who must
venture out into the world for extended periods of time.  Solamnic chain is a
full tunic (thigh length with full sleeves) of Masterwork chainmail.  Woven
into the center of the tunic with gold and silver cording is the symbol of the
Knight's order.
