boots stout walnut dyed~
   These stout boots are a color known to the Silvanesti people as 'servant's
brown'.  The color is achieved by creating a dye from crushed walnut shells.  
Their structure is quite sturdy (hence their name), as is most of the gear worn
by members of House Servitor.  Such practicality is something which they have
long since come to view as a necessity of their station.

helm master work master-work steel diamond trim bejeweled golden plume~
   A helm of peerless craftsmanship, this piece of armor is the work of a
master smithy.  Along the edges of the helm, diamonds have been formed and
inlaid in the steel to create a vibrant and nearly indestructible trim.  The
edges of the open face of the helm have been deliberately left without
adornment to avoid the chance that light reflected from one of the gems ends up
refracting into the eyes of the individual wearing it.  A long plume sits at
the top of the helm, each strand of it individually and painstakingly covered
in gold leaf that does not appear to rub off or fade.  How this was
accomplished, only the creator knows.  A stamp can be seen inside the helm at
the base of the neck.

dirk jewel crusted encrusted jewels~
   A dirk is often considered a weapon of last resort, as it is not
particularly deadly, cannot pierce thick armor, and serves very few secondary
purposes.  Mages are known to use them, as are thieves, who sometimes use a
pair of them to stab people with.  This dirk is made of one glossy piece of
steel, and has been set with jewels and gems, giving it a somewhat gaudy but
elegant appearance.  It has a very pointy tip, almost like a needle, making it
an excellent weapon for one who prefers finesse over brawn.

sword hilt solid amethyst-hilted~
   This is a longsword, with a long and elegant blade that shines like silver.
The hilt melds almost seemlessly into the blade, shaped in an artistically
pleasing manner to resemble a small lizard.  The lizard-shaped hilt fits nicely
into the hand, ensuring a proper grip.  The sword comes to a sharp point, and
the edge has diamond-like sharpness.  The hilt seems to be made of solid
indigo-hued amethyst.

semsianac ancient short sword~
   This ancient sword must date back to the time of the first Speaker of the
Stars.  At that time the craftsmen of Silvanost tried their hands at making
lengthened bronze daggers such as this.  The short, straight blade is
triangular in shape and about two spans long.    
   There are several clues to the  age and authenticity of this weapon.  Only the
first six inches of its solid bronze blade, which has no grooves or fillers to
lighten it, have been sharpened.  The shape and weight of the blade would also
indicate that the metal was cast in a mold: a trademark of early elven thrusting
weapons.

longsword sword elven~
   Over a millennia ago a pair of elven smiths discovered the secret of
enhancing a weapon in battle to the point that it was far more likely to
deliver the death blow than similar weapons made by more mundane men.  Their
secret was a core of mithril carefully balanced within the design of the
weapon.  Somehow it allowed a far better swing than would normally be expected.
  
   This longsword is an excellent specimen of a mithril-cored weapon.  Its lightweight
yet deadly blade are perfectly balanced by a sturdy bronze hilt which offers an
excellent grip.
