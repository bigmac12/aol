sign wooden simple~
   This sign appears to be made of plain, rough-cut pine.  It lacks any
markings of real craftsmanship and was obviously created for the most
utilitarian of purposes.

flute bloody wooden plaque aspen~
   How and why this flute came to have one end coated in blood is anyone's
guess.  Occasionally the odd story will surface in the bar about some great
event that occurred in the tavern's history that caused the instrument of music
to be used as an instrument of pain, but the likelihood of any one story being
more true than another is slim at best.  Expertly carved of pure aspen, the
flute is covered in blood from the mouthpiece down to about half its overall
length.  Whatever happened with it must have been gruesome indeed.

forge smokeless smelter~
   Carved and crafted out of a conglomerate of marble and heavy granite, this
forge is itself a work of art.  While functional, it is covered with beautiful
carvings of Sirrion's holy symbol across the matte-finished surface.  The stone
itself is black, but the carvings are inlaid in ruby and bloodstone which sets
them off in the most vibrant and attention-fetching way.
