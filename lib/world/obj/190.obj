wrought iron, with an antiqued silver finish.  Metal twines wrap around each
post capturing a still life of leaves and stems, while wire branches freely
twist and turn around the headboard and footboard.  Capping off the canopy are
four oval balls, surrounded by a quartet of cloverleaves.  Expensive black silk
curtains trimmed in silver hang from the canopy bars, currently open to reveal
the ample space upon the bed.  Many large, silk covered pillows are scattered
about the bed, lying atop sheets of black satin.  &n

   &K When you look closer, you can see that the ebony statue is, in fact, the
statue of a beautiful woman.  Her body is truly to die for.  Her waist is
nearly impossibly slender, and quite muscular.  Her legs are long and very
shapely.  Her bust is equally astonishing.  She stands with her arms raised,
appearing like a graceful acrobat about to perform some great dextrous feat.  
Her face is likewise very exquisite, with fine, nearly-elven features, full
lips, a delicate nose, and exotically-shaped eyes.  When you look at the eyes,
a feeling of sorrow washes over you.  Despite the statue's victorious pose, the
eyes are full of great sadness and loss.  The statue is clothed only by a few
well-placed sashes, which do nothing to conceal the beauty of its heavenly
body.  &n

the owner of the cot.  The posts closest to the wall are about eight feet high,
and those further into the room are about six feet high.  When a body fills the
cot, it sags to about three and a half or four feet off the floor, slightly
above waist height.  The cot looks rather inviting and festive.  Strung in the
mesh of the cot are various beads, feathers, and tassles.  The rope of the mesh
is fairly elastic, and strong enough that even a fully-grown ogre jumping up
and down on it would not bend it badly out of shape or break it.

the cabinet, its source being magical.  Foodstuffs are to be placed within so
that they wouldn't spoil.  The view of the cabinet from the outside is
deceiving because looking into it, there is definitely a lot more room than
appearances dictate.

   The large pool is fed from above by a magical waterfall.  The pool bubbles
slightly, but the water is kept at a comfortable temperature.  The pool is
shallow near the edges, the water only waist deep, but gradually deepens at the
center.  The water from the waterfall cascades into the center of the pool away
from the edges so that the spray doesn't harass those there.  The plants that
line the perimeter of the pool offers shade and privacy as well as a sense of
being outdoors.
