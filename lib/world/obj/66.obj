speak with the arena master.  For a small price you may borrow the key to the
arena, once inside 2 prep rooms are provided to house any equipment you wish to
store during the fight.  It is strongly suggested that all participants have a
room here in Guthorg, so that if need be we have somewhere to send your
equipment.  Fights work best when three people are present, one to hold the
key, and the two participants.  The arena master will buy back the key, and
then return your deposit.  Please note that the arena master only has the one
copy of the key, so returning it would be very helpful to him.
