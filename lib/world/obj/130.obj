E
short sword shortsword~
   This shortsword is well-made though not of the highest quality workmanship.
It bears an iron blade, functional yet inexpensive, and the pommel of the sword
is of polished hardwood.  The guard of the blade has a faint scrollwork design
on either side, protecting the wielder's hand.    
~
E
blade iron~
   The blade of this shortsword is made out of a basic iron- it appears to be
of reasonable quality for iron, but still not one of the most superior metals.
It has a narrow channel cut into the length of the blade.    
~
E
pommel wooden wood~
   The pommel of the shortsword is made of a hardwood, perhaps mahogany or
teak.  It is polished and oiled with linseed, and has a warm, light brown hue.
The grain of the wood is evident, adding character and design to the otherwise
simply and utilitarian handle.

sword short shortsword~
   This longsword is well-balanced and sturdy, forged of a fine steel and
sharped to a keen edge.  Etched into the blade of the longsword is a beautiful
and intricate pattern of chased aspen leaves and vines, intertwining along the
length of the blade on either side.  The swordguard is also crafted into a
pattern of wrapping aspen leaves, highlighted with bronze and green laquer.  

~
E
blade leaves aspen etching~
   The blade of this longsword is etched with a breathtakingly beautiful design
of aspen leaves, intertwining with a running vine pattern.  The etchings are
filled with copper, highlighting the design in a faint green patina.  The
design runs along the length of the blade on both sides, almost as if the
leaves and vines were actually running around the swordblade.    
~
E
swordguard guard~
   The swordguard, designed to protect the wielder's hand, is actually composed
of a few aspen leaves, extending from the top of the pommel out and downwards
over the hand.  The leaves are made from the same quality steel as the blade,
and coated with green enamel over the leaves.  The veins of the leaves are
highlighted in bronze, dding a level of beauty and realism to this otherwise
utilitarian weapon.

of an eagle in flight.  The craftsmanship is quite good, and the stone has been
polished just enough to give it a dull shine.  It hangs from a simple leather
cord.

OOC: This item once placed on a wear location, cannot be removed. Just as in
real life, once you put a tattoo on you can't take it off. Even an immortal
won't be able to remove this item from you. The only way to remove it is by
dying. (in any case, not very realistic for it to just 'disappear')

If you plan to use it, you need to wear using the specific location you want
it to be placed on. ie, 'wear tattoo arms', or 'wear tattoo wrist'. If you
don't specify, it will choose a spot for you.

The available locations are:

NECK HEAD LEGS HANDS ARMS WRIST ANKLE BACK SHOULDER FEET BODY FACE

When using these kinds of items, please use common sense. If you have hair,
don't wear it on your head. Females probably shouldn't wear it on the BODY,
since you can't wear anything else over it. Yes, it may be unrealistic, but
that's how the code works. It doesn't matter if you SHOULD be able to wear
an item over your tattoo, you just can't. :)

tattoo ivy twining forest green~
   This tattoo has been drawn by a master of the art; so fine is the detail
that one could almost believe the leaves of the twining ivy were real.  
Whatever substance was used to create this tattoo provides a vibrant, lasting
color.  The ivy vines twist and coil about in random patterns, subtly
accentuating key portions of the body it is placed on.    

(See ivyooc for ooc details, please)

ribcage ogre ogres bleached remains~
   This is the large, bleached remains of an ogre's ribcage.  It remains mostly
intact, and is actually quite sturdy.  Beings smaller than ogres could likely
use this as armor, though with the holes between the ribs it becomes somewhat
ineffective.  If a craftsman was able to work on it and perhaps incorporate it
into another type of armor, it surely would provide excellent protection.

pelt shadowy black dire wolf~
   This soft, shadowy-black pelt is quite large, and the wolf it came from must
have been huge indeed.  The 'skin' portion of the pelt; that is to say the
underside, is quite resilient.  It seems almost unnaturally so, and could
likely turn even a blade unless struck hard enough.  This pelt could easily be
worn for fashion or for practicality, and is cut in such a way as to be worn
over the shoulders or about the body like a cloak of sorts.

   This claw is huge, and most certainly has come from some form of dire
animal; most likely a dire wolf.  It is jet-black in color, and is wickedly
sharp.  It could rend flesh and armor with little trouble.  It could be used as
an impromptu weapon, though using it as it is would be a bit unwieldy.

if there is a torch down the hole.  A few feet down the hole, the rocks start
to look like stairs and it seems like it turns into a small path.

The belt is surprisingly large, considering it looks like a kender's belt.
