--== THE GODS OF LIGHT ==--

** Paladine, the Platinum Dragon **  
Paladine is Father of Good and Master of Law. He speaks for the gods
of Good, leading through example and encouragement. He upholds
the laws of Good by assisting the righteous and renouncing the evil.
Paladine and Takhisis were the creators of the first material things,
the dragons. Takhisis corrupted the chromatic dragons, leaving the
metallics to Paladine, and this act began the rift between Good and
Evil.  Paladine and his twin sons, Kiri-Jolith and Habbakuk created
the Knights of Solamnia, choosing the mortal Vinas Solamnus to establish
the knighthood based on the ideals of truth, justice and honor. Paladine
is the patron of the Order of the Rose.  He also had a third son with Mishakal,
Solinari.  Paladine's primary symbol is the silver triangle.  His other symbols
are the pine tree (Silvanesti) or an anvil (Thorbardin).  His colors are silver
and white.

** Solinari, the Mighty Hand **
Solinari is the god of Good magic, and established the Order of the White 
Robes to administer it. With the exception of Krynn, which he loves deeply,
Solinari treasures magic over every aspect of life, death and afterlife. He is
the third son of Paladine and Mishakal. Solinari's symbol is a white circle or
sphere, and his colors are white and silver.

** Mishakal, the Healing Hand **
Mishakal is the goddess whose influences are healing, knowledge, fertility,
life, beauty and blessing. She is Paladine's wife, and the couple have
three sons - the twins Kiri-Jolith and Habbakuk and the third son,
Solinari. Mishakal's symbol is the infinity sign, and her color is sky blue.

** Majere, Master of the Mind **
Majere is the god of organization, industry, control, meditation, faith and
dreams. His followers lead simple lives devoid of luxury and filled with
meditation, self-discipline and deep thought. His primary symbol is a
copper spider. His other symbols are a single rose (Qualinesti, Silvanesti)
and the mantis (Solamnia). His color is copper.

** Kiri-Jolith, Sword of Justice **
Kiri-Jolith is the god of glory, honor, obedience, justice and righteous
warfare. With his twin Habbakuk, and his father Paladine, he helped
create the Knights of Solamnia and is the patron of the Order of the
Sword. His symbols are bison's horns or a horned battleaxe
(Thorbardin, Kharolis) and his colors are brown and white.

** Habbakuk, the Fisher King **
Habbakuk created and rules all creatures of land and sea. He represents
the eternal cycle of nature, thereby also symbolizing eternal life.
He and his older twin Kiri-Jolith, together with their father Paladine created
the Knights of Solamnia and Habbakuk is the patron of the Order of the Crown.
His symbols are the blue bird and the blue phoenix (Ergoth).  His colors are
deep blue and white.

** Branchala, Song of Life **
Considered by the elves and kender to be the highest god, Branchala is
the god of music. A companion of Habbakuk since the beginning of time,
Branchala imbued Krynn's first creatures with the lyric and melody of his
immortal soul. His symbols are a bard's harp or a flute (Qualinesti,
Silvanesti). His colors are yellow and green.

--== THE GODS OF NEUTRALITY ==--

** Gilean, the Void **
Before creation, the High God wrote the Tobril, the book of all knowledge
and true names, to lay down the designs of the universe. The High God
did not consider any of the gods he created trustworthy enough to guard
the Tobril, so he found Gilean, a scribe so scrupulous as to have never
penned an error and entrusted the Tobril to him. Gilean guards the Tobril
and is the patriarch of the Neutral gods. His symbol is an open book
and his color is gray.

** Lunitari, the Veiled Maiden **
The goddess of Neutral magic and illusions, Lunitari was born of Gilean and
an unknown mother, though some suggest she sprang full-grown from her
father's thoughts. She founded the Order of the Red Robes to promote
Neutral magic. Her symbol is a red circle or sphere, her color red or magenta.

** Sirrion, the Flowing Flame **
Sirrion is the god of creative flame and natural power and sculpts fire into
beautiful forms. He controls every flame, from the sun to the low-burning
wick. His companion is Shinare, an argumentative couple due to his
temperamental and artistic nature in conflict with her practicality and
opportunism. His symbol is a multi-colored fire. His colors are bright red
and yellow.

** Reorx, the Forge **
The god of manufacture, technology and metallurgy, Reorx is considered by
the dwarves of Ansalon to be the greatest god. Humans perceive him as
merely Kiri-Jolith's helper. Reorx tamed chaos to forge the world. His second
greatest creation, the Greystone of Gargath, led to the emergence of dwarves,
gnomes and kender and many consider him the father of these races. His
symbols are a forging hammer or dwarven hammer (Thorbardin). His colors
are slate grey and red.

** Chislev, the Beast **
Chislev is nature incarnate. According to legend, the seasons change with the
moods of her heart. She is served by every beast and plant. Her symbol is
a feather of brown, yellow and green, which are her colors.

** Zivilyn, the Tree of Life **
Zivilyn is the god of all wisdom and is the celestial Tree of Life. His
branches extend into all times and places. As Gilean holds the knowledge of
the universe, Zivilyn holds its wisdom. Zivilyn is the companion of Chislev,
a relationship seen by most mortals as a perfect marriage. Zivilyn's
symbol is a great green or gold tree, sometimes a vallenwood. His colors
are green and gold.

** Shinare, Winged Victory **
Shinare, the goddess of wealth, industry and commerce, has many dwarven
worshippers. She also finds many followers among merchants, mercenaries
and profit-minded adventurers of other races. She is considered by all to
be the champion of freedom and self-destiny. She cannot tolerate laziness
and attributes poverty or stupidity to sloth. Her symbol is a griffon's wing
and her colors are gold, silver and brown.

--== THE GODS OF DARKNESS ==--

** Takhisis, Queen of Darkness **
Takhisis is the embodiment of evil, enjoying preying on the weaknesses of
others and using the greatest desires to enslave them. She is cold and
brilliant, a master of exploitation. She hates good, loves cruelty and hoards
wealth. In the Age of Dreams, she was Paladine's mate and consort but when they
forged the first beings, the dragons, Takhisis grew selfish and corrupted the
chromatic dragons. She left Paladine and now consorts with Sargonnas, a god
of fury and vengeance. The passion between them vacillates between insatiable
lust and deep loathing. They bore two children, Nuitari and Zeboim. Takhisis'
one other child, Artha, the demigoddess of wanton lust and greed was sired
by Hiddukkel masquerading as Chemosh. Takhisis' symbol is a black
crescent. Her color is black of utter darkness and irridescent black of beetle
wings. Her influences are over night, evil dragons, hatred, intrigue and chaos.

** Nuitari, Devouring Dark **
Nuitari is the god of black magic and the son of Takhisis and Sargonnas. He
founded the Order of the Black Robes, perhaps the most secret and coveted
Order on Krynn. While those that practice black magic may gain incredible
power, it comes at the price of control. Nuitari watches in wry amusement as
those who try to master his art are overcome by its dark power. His symbol
is a black circle or sphere, his color is black.

** Sargonnas, Dark Vengeance **
Takhisis' consort, Sargonnas is the sometimes explosive god of vengeance,
rage, deserts and volcanoes. He embodies the destructive passion of fire.
As Takhisis is both his greatest ally and his greatest enemy, he plots both
for and against her. He is treacherous and paranoid, and works his revenge
through insidious means. His symbol is a red condor or a red fist
(Thorbardin, Istar). His colors are red and black.

** Morgion, the Black Wind **
This god of decay and disease refuses the company of other gods and does
not discuss plans with them. He despises all healthy things, actively striving
to corrupt them with disease and decay. His symbols are a hood with two
red eyes, an upside-down axe (Thorbardin) or a rat's claw (Hylo). His colors
are deep brown and black.

** Chemosh, Lord of Death **
In the Age of Dreams, Chemosh was drawn to Krynn by Takhisis, to serve as
a lieutenant to marshal the legions of death. As lord of false redemption,
Chemosh offers eternal life to the unwary. Recipients spend immortality in
an undead and eternally corrupted body while he himself grows in power
and longevity. His symbol is a yellow skull. His colors are black and a
sickly yellow.

** Zeboim, Darkling Sea **
Zeboim, the Sea Queen, is the impetuous and volatile daughter of
Takhisis and Sargonnas. Her unpredictable tempers make her a dangerous
foe and lethal friend. She provides her followers the vast wealth of lost
treasure ships. She receives petitions and sacrifices from seamen wishing
good weather and safe travel. Those who displease her through some real
or imagined slight never see harbor again. Her symbol is a turtle-shell
pattern, and her colors are green and red.

**Hiddukel, Prince of Lies **
This god of ill-gotten wealth and deals is the patron god of evil businessmen
and dishonest merchants. Greed and mischief drive all Hiddukel's
transactions. He controls all ill-gotten wealth, using it to corrupt honest and
greedy men alike. His symbol is a set of broken merchant's scales. His
colors are red and bone white.

book suede tree small~

There was a time, in years past, when a soul could venture into Turbidus
Square without giving much thought to the trees lining the nearby avenues.
That all changed, thanks to a kender oh! I mean a -famous- kender by the
name of Kesseltop Featherfingers.

You see, one day Lord Apharot Soltharus was receiving a visit in the
Square by the goddess Chislev. As kenders are wont to do, Kesseltop
was chattering incessantly and making the good knight's conversation
with the goddess less than enlightening. Seeing this, Chislev created a
magic pine cone that spun, suspended in the air before the kender's
eyes. Kesseltop was so enchanted by this that Lord Apharot and
Chislev were able to finish their discussion in relative peace.

Going on to handle other godly business, imagine Chislev's surprise
when she later heard the kender praying to make the pine cone grow!
Turns out Kesseltop, at the encouragement of a good (and not-so-famous)
friend Thistledown Topknot, had not only caught the spinning pine cone,
but had planted it as well.

Zivilyn, thinking to please his beloved Chislev and free her time for more
pressing matters, prompty answered the kender's prayers. However, so
lost in thought about his consort was he, that he failed to notice the genus
of the tree he grew. So it came to be that an oak tree sprang from the
kender's buried pine cone.

Well, Kesseltop was quite proud of herself to have singlehandedly grown
an oak ... err pine tree in the Square. Her friends, however, thought it a
bit odd at the very least. She was determined that it needed a name and
wanted desperately to name it after herself, it was after all, her tree, right?
Her friend Jenrodan, knowing his goddess Chislev would be perhaps
slighted by that, suggested a compromise by naming the tree a pinoak.
Kesseltop was having none of it.

A few weeks passed and the tree was growing quite fast, already towering
over the Square and becoming quite the conversation piece without any
further events. But then, that was before Kesseltop found a genie's
lantern in the tree! How it came to be there is undoubtedly another whole
story, and if you have the fortitude, perhaps you might ask Kesseltop to
tell you -that- story. In any case, the genie promptly offered the kender
three wishes, and not surprisingly, her very first wish was to name the
tree Ye Kesseltop. Genies, you see, just have to be contrary and don't
seem to give a whit about a god's opinion of things when giving out wishes.

It was shortly after that that Ye Kesseltop began to fall on hard times.
Chislev found its upper branches a rather convenient place to hide Reorx's
anvil, being that the silly dwarf doesn't seem to like heights much. Far worse
though, was the confused barbarian that came to Kalaman trying to chop
him down!

Misae, a plainsman, had lost the love of his life and shortly thereafter, what
remained passively as his mind. Coming across Ye Kesseltop, and hearing
the story of it to that point, he was convinced this tree was bad medicine
and immediately set to felling it.

Of course, all Chislev's forest guardians were enraged and searched for
Misae everywhere, but he was devious and couldn't be found. After his first
strike at the tree, a big gash was opened and the tree whimpered out loud
in agony. A lovely elven ranger by the name of Mira was so concerned by
its pain that she stayed with the tree a goodly amount of time, and wrapped
the gash in her own black scarf. This consoled the tree greatly, and Chislev
soon healed him entirely. So grateful was Ye Kesseltop that he promptly
began growing oranges to reward the elven maiden for her good deed.

Of course, you can well imagine how Misae felt about coming across this
"evil" tree sporting oranges all of a sudden! He immediately attacked it,
losing all track of where he was. He soon found himself surrounded by
friends of the kender and followers of Chislev that didn't seem to care
much for his actions. Being unable to speak in the Common tongue, he was
unable to express how evil the tree was, not that anyone would have believed
him. Quite a fracas resulted, and sadly enough, Jenrodan was left no
alternative but to use force in preventing further damage to the tree, and
Misae was killed.

All this, it would seem, might be enough adventure for any tree but not
Ye Kesseltop. Nooo, he just has to find adventures every day just to keep
everyone on their toes, certainly not the least of which is Chislev. (How
exactly she has repaid Zivilyn for his "help" is also another story and quite
likely not appropriate reading material for the younger generation).
So dear reader, our story does not have an ending, only the most recent
event in this famous tree's life.

There he stood, quite minding his own business, when along came a
gully dwarf absolutely enraged that he wouldn't move out of the way.
Now, perhaps if the tree had feet, it might have cooperated more fully,
but as you well know that's just not the way of trees and Ye Kesseltop
was no different. He stood resolutely, bearing the brunt of several kicks
along with a goodly stream of profanity. Being the smart tree that he is,
he managed to figure out after a while that Gurp was mistaking him for
an obstinate dwarf. This did little to change anything though and the
debate might have gone on all day had not Chislev heard the tree's
silent chuckling and went to check on him.

Seeing Kesseltop allowing Gurp to kick her tree, she was taken aback
and reprimanded the poor kender quite harshly before turning her
attention on Gurp. Silly gully dwarf would not give up the ruse even in
front of a goddess! Consequently, he was quickly encased in vines and
planted until he thought over his options more carefully. Chislev's
good servant Jenrodan was patient enough to explain things to the
deluded dwarf and he was free in a matter of hours, or perhaps it was
days...

Once free, Gurp and Kesseltop, who had somehow along the way picked
up the rather awkward middle name Treeminder, got to talking and trying
to figure out the confusion between them. Now, other than gnome
inventions, there's very little in life as comical as watching a kender
and a gully dwarf try to make logic of anything. Yet they certainly tried.
That, too, is another story which I won't trouble you with, dear reader.
Suffice it to say, it ended with a flea infestation in Kalaman that several
residents are -still- itching from.

Thus ends the history (for today at least) of Krynn's famed Ye Kesseltop tree.

   A WARNING TO ALL VISITORS The Kalaman City Guard will not tolerate violence
of any kind within the city proper.  If you are caught committing any acts
including, but not limited to, murder, rape, thievery, or hostile use of magic,
you will be dispatched of immediately in a manner which you will probably find
most unsatisfactory.  If you wish to prevent being dealt with as such, avoid
committing any crimes, especially in the presence of guardsmen.    

  A further note to all new visitors to the city. The dockyards to the east of the
city and the temple of Paladine immediately to the north-west are excellent places
to begin one's journey.

   This pendant has been made out of finely tempered steel and forged into a
disc.  On the center of the disc is a large dwarven hammer.  The hammer appears
to be the type of hammer that could be seen at a forge, striking metal to
create new weapons or armor.  The handle isn't very long when compared to the
head of the hammer.  At the top of the disc, there is a circle on it, allowing
it to be hung from a chain.  The chain is made out of thick steel.

Committee (v) - Three to n-1 Gnomes thinking (given time) on a subject which
may or may not be related to the problem which the Committee was originally put
together to solve.  In the known part of our history, no Committee has (yet)
managed to solve the original problem, but many has been able to increase the 
problems for other Committees, thereby securing the offices for a 
large number of GIC's (Gnome In Charge).

A Committee is expected to be required by the inventor/cook as soon as one 
or more of the following occurs:

*He finds he cannot solve the problem by himself, and does not want to ask  
another Gnome for advice.
*His Guild decides he cannot solve the problem by himself.
*He actually believes a Committee would be useful in solving the problem.
*Members of a Committee decides his problem relates to their assignment.
*His invention appears to work perfectly, and needs adjustment by an expert.

The new Committee now must do a number of things in order to be recognized  
by the other Committees:

1. Make up a schedule that promises to deliver a result on the matter  
within 2 years.
2. Meet with the Inventors Guild and explain why the schedule says "20  
years" instead of "2".
3. Meet with the Inventor and invite him to the Committee as "Technical 
Expert in Charge of Solving the Problem this Committee is Expected To 
Solve".
4. Find another new Committee and formally Recognize it before The Committee 
in Charge of Deciding Wether an Gnomish Inventor is In Need of Help And If 
This Help Can Be Given By the Assignment of A New Committee".
5. Call the neighbours and apologize in advance for any inconveniences 
caused by expected (and, in some cases, unexpected) explosions and/or riots 
that the Committees work might cause.

The Inventor responsible for all this may now be released from the chamber 
where he was locked up, (when the aforementioned "Committee in Charge of 
Deciding.." started to look at his case) in order to avoid that he might 
accidentally find a solution to his problem and leave a whole Committee 
without proper assignment, and finally return to his work.
