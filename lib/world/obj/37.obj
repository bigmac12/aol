chain elvish light elven mail chainmail delicate shirt ~
   This long, mailed shirt is made of an extremely light material, worked in
delicate interlocking rings of the highest quality.  Designed to hang to
mid-thigh on the average elvish frame, this shirt offers a good deal of
protection to the torso and arms.  The brilliant luster, light weight, and
remarkable durability of this garment lends credence to the remarkable skill of
the crafter and the material itself, the singular metal known as mithril, a
medium worked in only by the most skilled of elvish hands for ages untold.

   This tunic has been tailored with care by the hands of one with no small
skill.  While perhaps not the finest of quality in materials or of the most
expert craft, this garment is by no means shoddy or poorly done.  The soft,
smooth cloth that has been used in it's making has been dyed a light, gentle
green, it's edges set with tasteful embroidery in the form of small aspen
leaves in golden thread.  The cut of the garment is left loose and flowing,
tailored without sleeves for a maximum of freedom in movement.

breastplate elven elvish gleaming polished aspen leaf golden~
   This breastplate is a marvel to behold.  Clearly it has been designed as
much as to impress as it has to protect, for it's beauty and craftmanship is
rivaled by few in the realms.  Forged of steel brought to a high sheen, this
breastplate has a sense of flow to it that almost resembles a thing alive, so
elegant is the form and style invoked.  The breastplate is left clean and
unmarred by etchings but for a singular, exquistely done aspen leaf in gold
placed directly over it's center.  While quite sturdy and obviously highly
functional, this piece also speaks of a beauty of simplicity, making a show as
much of what detail is used as what is not.

   This blade is remarkably well-balanced, drifting lightly in the hand, it's
deadly edge seeming to carry with it virtually no weight to tire the arm.  
Forged to be functional, this blade is also highly decorative, it's pommel and
cross-guard delicately styled, the image of a aspen leaf set to the cross-piece
at the point where the blade springs forth.  Light etchings of vines and leaves
trace a portion of the razor-sharp blade, lending an air of elegence even in
the flicker of steel.

throne emerald~
   Grown to a thing of fable and legend itself, the emerald throne of the
Silvanesti is the focal point of all light within the Tower of the Stars.  
Crafted by masters of both House Mason and House Mystic eons ago, the throne
was crafted through the art of magic, shaped of raw emerald, not hewn.  In this
manner the throne was formed of nature, not ripped from it, crafted for
Silvanos himself at the rise of the elvish nation and intended to stand at the
heart of Silvanost for all the days of the elves.

   This slender bench has been lovingly crafted by what one can only assume to
be the hand of an expert elvish craftsman.  Formed of beautiful white granite,
this bench is both delicate to the eye yet remarkably sturdy, bearing a great
deal more weight than most would credit it.  It's lines are simple and smooth,
flowing gently from one to the next with a sense of quiet grace, lending it an
effect that seems to neither detract from it's surroundings or add to them.

   Formed of delicate rose quartz, this beautiful fountain is formed in a
simple, yet remarkably elegant style.  Smooth, flowing lines give it a sense of
grace without appearing ostentatious, lending the eye to flow over it without
being disturbed from the beauty of the surrounding gardens.  A small basin
rests near the middle of the fountain, the cool, clear waters trickling
melodiously from the top and further downward to gather at a small pool at the
fountain's base.  While the smaller basin appears intended for drinking, the
larger pool at the base is filled with a variety of breathtaking water lilies.

smooth, simple wooden handle of this spade is the symbol of a small harp.  
Intertwined along with the harp symbol is the sign of the House Gardener of

not appearing overly exravagant, is of fine quality and has been well-kept and
maintained, looking much as it must have when first tailored.  Left of a
considerable length, it appears as though it may be worn in several fashions.
