cloak snow-white elegant long cloth~
   The fabric of the cloak is purest white, unblemished by any coloring of any
sort.  Its true beauty lies in its simplicity.  Looking very closely, there is
no sign of hemming of any sort.  The edges of the fabric just seem to be
thickened and neat, almost as if the fabric just naturally took this shape on
its own without being woven by mortal hands.  The cloak is very long, trailing
all the way to the upper calves of the average human or elven wearer, to the
ankles of smaller folk.  Though the fabric is thin and whispy, it is warm, and
stays in place undisturbed by wind or weather.  The cloak is fixed with a deep
cowl of equally elegant fashion.

just within the heart of the crystal, and when you look at it, it opens its
mouth in a loud scream which only you can hear!  It is painful beyond
endurance, so soon you close your eyes and try to blot out the sound.  It
vanishes, but when you open your eyes and once again look into the crystal's
flawless surface, the skull has vanished.  You feel different after looking at
the thing, but whether you feel better or worse, you are unable to discern.  
From all casual observance, nothing inside the ball can be seen.  It seems to
be a simple, flawless gemstone of great size.

almost transparent, seeming to be made of pure ice.  It is extremely cold to
the touch, and takes a steady hand to hold and use it properly.  It seems

that since the earliest days of the world, this staff has been passed to the

point is longer than the one on either side.  Its shape makes it an excellent
weapon for one who fights defensively, as well as one who likes to hide his
strike from his enemies.  This particular sai does not seem to be made from any
recognizable material.  Instead, it seems to have been brought into being by
the coalescing of violent, dark energy and given the form of this deadly
assassin's weapon.  Small enough that two such weapons may be wielded
simultaneously, it is nonetheless deadly enough to do damage comparable to many
larger swords.

a long hilt which must be gripped with two hands to be wielded properly.  The

The most magnificent thing about this sword is its hilt, which is beautiful to
behold.  The hilt is smooth, glossy, and azure-blue in colour.  The grip on the
hilt is firm, but comfortable for most average, human-or-elf-sized hands.  The
pommel of the hilt seems to be weighted by something, giving the weapon a
greater sense of balance, and making it more effective when used in battle.

clear the way for other trees.  Such is nature's way.  But, in the meantime, it

to make sure that no other trees in the area are needlessly harmed.  Some
burning embers fall from the tree, but hiss harmlessly as they land in the

the petals of the flower will not outright kill a man, it will make him very
very ill, and after eating them, the imbiber will only crave to find more black
lotus.  Smoking the dried petals of the flower is said to have a pleasant,
euphoria-inducing effect and is thought to be less toxic.  However, caution
must be used when dealing with Black Lotus.  Those who abuse the plant are
known as "Lotus Eaters".  It is rumoured that long-term use of the flower in
any form leads to the eater losing his soul and forever wandering the earth in
a zombified state.  The flower is very beautiful, but any who know these facts
give the flowers a wide berth.  The Black Lotus is very valueable as well, if

   Bloodroot is one of the earliest and most beautiful spring bloomers.  It has
a lovely white flower and produces only a single leaf and a flowering scape
about 6 inches high.  After flowering the leaves increase in size, the
underside paler showing prominent veins.  The white flower is wax-like with
golden stamens.  The seed is an oblong narrow pod about 1 inch long.  The
rootstock is thick, round and fleshy, slightly curved at ends, and contains an
orange-red juice, and is about 1 to 4 inches long, with orange-red rootlets.  
When dried it breaks with a short sharp fracture, little smell, taste bitter
acrid and persistent, powdered root causes sneezing and irritation of the nose.
The root is collected in the autumn, after leaves die down; it must be stored
in a dry place or it quickly deteriorates.

wolfsbane herb herbs sprig few dark green plants~
   Wolfsbane, also known as Monk's Hood is a leafy herb commonly found in herb
gardens in the more temperate regions of Ansalon.  Wolfsbane in its raw form is
rather poisonous, and can make a person very ill.  There is much lore
surrounding other uses of Wolfsbane, the most common of which involves the
powers it has against undead and lycanthropes.  If such stories are true, or
merely wishful folklore is known only to those who have spent their lives in
the study of herbs.  To eat this herb raw, though, is something that only a
fool would do lightly.

bush, leaving but one thorn upon its stalk.  The thorn is pointy, but is a

possible to pry one of the eyes loose, though that would prove dangerous.  Not

monolith black ebony towering tower statue~
   This great and terrifying structure casts a long shadow over the forest
here.  It must stand some twenty feet high.  When you step back a moment to
look at it, only then are you able to discern what it represents.  The monolith
is in the shape of a woman, horrible and terrifying to behold.  Her hair is
shaped into that of snakes.  Her arms are outstretched, each one ending in a
great clawed hand.  One hand, her right, is lowered to within six feet of the
ground, and it is cupped in such a fashion that a man-sized creature could sit
in it.  The idea of taking that seat is not made any more comforting by the
fact that the clawed hand is dripping with warm blood.  A recent sacrifice has
been made here.  The woman is in a kneeling position upon what you realize now
to be the back of a gigantic sea turtle.  There can be no mistaking at this
point that this glistening ebony statue is a shrine to the evil sea goddess:
Zeboim.  Her eyes are two glowing-red crystal spheres which ooze with a
malignant hatred of all things living.  It is difficult not to be glad that
this is simply a statue, and poses no immediate threat to you one way or

point of the star holding a tiny, bright red ruby.  The center of the earring
holds a ruby that is larger than the others.  It is very lightweight, and
catches the light around it very nicely.

dragonscale armor suit~
   This suit of dragonscale armor seems to simply ooze dark magicks.  It has no
doubt been crafted from the scales of a very large, very ancient black dragon,
but in addition to that, there is an odd black aura that hangs just over the
surface of the armor like a poisonous fog.  There is one scale out of place,
just by the neck, one green scale which looks to have come from a different
kind of dragon.  That one scale stands out from the rest of the armor, glowing
ever so slightly.  When the armor is viewed from a distance, only that scale
stands out.  The rest appears flat black.

bone long sharp sword nature's ruin nature dark glow~
   This huge sword has been crafted from a single large bone.  There is no sign
of lamination at all, signifying that indeed, the sword has been made from one
bone and only one.  The animal it came from must have been enormous.  The blade
is sharper than most steel blades, serrated and wicked looking.  The blade is
thick and curved, and tapers seemlessly to a handle, which is wrapped with raw
hide.  The bone is carved with strange runes, and has a dark aura about it.

boots pair winged high high-quality wings~
   These boots are made of white suede with green stitching.  While the quality
of the boots themselves is nearly peerless, what sets these particular boots
apart is the small set of wings on each heel.  They are magically enchanted to
speed the running of the one who wears them, and even allows that person to
glide through the air for a time.  When not in use, the wings are still, but
when the wearer is running and using the boots, the wings come to life.

shimmering breeches pair interwoven~
   These breeches are actually rather extravagent-looking.  They appear on
first viewing to be made of some kind of metallic thread, but once you look
closer, you see the truth.  On a backing of a silky, fine cloth are mounted
little hard leaves, each an irridescent green in colour.  The leaves are all so
small that they form a sheet of shimmering green, appearing not so much as a
horde of leaves, but as a single item of surpassing beauty and craftmanship.

tunic silk green~
   This tunic is made of heavy silk of the finest quality.  It is a deep green
in colour, shimmering in even the faintest light.  The cloth is brocaded with
forest patterns and is exceedingly beautiful.  It feels warm, and though the
material is not overly thick, it is always warm to the touch.  When you feel
it, you realize that the tunic actually has a few layers to it, the silk making
up only the topmost layer.  There is almost definitely more to this apparently
simple and beautiful garment than meets the eye.
