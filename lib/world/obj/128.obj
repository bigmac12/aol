dreamcatcher dream catcher stick string woven web~
   Bits of string have been woven and knotted together to form an intricate web
which has been attached to a stick the thickness of a man's finger and as long
as his forearm.  Some tribes think that these objects will catch the dreams of
anyone holding them while they sleep.  What is supposed to be done with the
dreams varies from place to place but the catching of the dream is consistant.

   Inspecting this skull more closely, you find that it is an exact replica of
a male human skull.  From the size, down to the smallest details it has been
flawlessy crafted so that one could not tell the difference from a real skull,
save the mineral it is constructed from.  It has also been crafted in such a
way, that when held in an independent light source, it refracts the light to
shine out of the mouth and eyesockets, creating an eery display.  Despite the
skull being made of quartz, it is strangely as light as a feather and feels as
though at any moment it could float away.

which allow for free ease of movement.  The steel is thick, but remarkably
light, giving up none of its strength.  It is well-polished and maintained, and
bears some engravings along the edges, giving it an elegant and beautiful
appearance.  Thick leather straps can be adjusted to fit most sets of
human-sized legs.  The nature of the armor, and the way they are fitted
however, makes it so that only human wearers could fit the armor comfortably to
themselves.  Others would have to make such drastic changes to the structure as
to completely destroy the beauty and integrity of the steel plate.

the end.  This hoop, when looped around the wrist helps prevent the weapon from
being lost, which is helpful, because the strength of the swing one needs to
wield it properly might cause an undue amount of slippage to occur.  The blade
is curved and very, very sharp, though the weapon's weight can be both a
benefit and a liability.  It is suited to a more brutal sort of combat.

ram battering huge oak immense~
   A battering ram is an improvement on the basic 'felled tree' which was used
for years by teams of ogres in battering down doors to devastating effect.  
The battering ram is an improvement in that the branches of the tree are cut
off, an iron head has been placed at the ramming end, and handles have been
placed along its length to make it easier to be carried.  A battering ram is
useless without a team of between eight and fourteen men capable of carrying
it.  Together, they thrust the head of the ram against a door which normally
gives way after a few solid hits.  The head of the ram is shaped, ironically,
like a ram.  How very clever.  The handles are made of strong iron and are
bolted securely in place along the ram's length, seven on each side.

small pair thick goggles~
   The small pair of thick goggles seem to have been through quite a lot.  The
lenses are dusty and hard to see through.  The strap that secures the goggles
onto the face is also worn and dirty.  The goggles itself is rather small and
seems to be made to fit on the smaller races of Krynn.

fur has been placed around the small set of lenses allowing the observer to use
them for long periods of time without being uncomfortable.

   This longbow is finely crafted from thin layers of horn and wood.  While you
cannot determine what animal the horn came from the wood is obviously ash.  
Sinew has been used to string this bow which stands almost six feet high.

make transporting it easier.

   This piece of fruit, plump by any standards, is heavily concentrated with
seeds.  It gives off a fragrant, sweet-smelling aroma, one that many may find
appetizing.  It is dark in color and the base of the fruit has been subjected
to pecking or perhaps the small nibbles of an animal.

   This tree is obviously young and freshly planted.  It is barely old enough
to yield fruit, which it does bear but very sparsely.  It seems that blackbirds
have nested in its green branches, for they can be seen flying to and from a
dirty brown nest.
