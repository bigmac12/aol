blade.  However, the prongs of a sai are rounded, and the tips are somewhat
blunt.  The weapon is mainly used to catch an oppponents sword or staff in the
prongs and wrench it from their grasp.  Farmers often use this weapon as a
farming tool as well, replacing the trowel.  This particular sai is crafted of
dark, sturdy iron, and the hilt is wrapped with black leather strips.
