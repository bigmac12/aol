set swords finely shortsword slim blade large longsword runic~
   The set of swords displayed upon the top of the pillar are beautifully
crafted by an expert weaponsmith, and look perfectly balanced.  The smaller,
slim blade has a handle of pearl inlaid with gold veins, and the larger sword
was crafted with an odd fiery opal handle, also inlaid with gold veins, giving
it the illusion of flames within the handle.  Along the larger blade can be
seen etched runic symbols of elven script, flowing with elven magic.  Clearly,
these weapons were made as a pair, and are valuable - not only for their
craftsmanship, but also as a displayed gift to the gods of warfare.

small marble pillar display~
   The small pillar is made of smooth white marble, streaked with veins of gold
and silver, creating a crackling pattern within the marble.  Along the pillar
is carvings of dragons winding their way up toward the top of the pillar, being
ridden by holy warriors, frozen eternally in the marble as they reach for the
set of finely crafted swords that are displayed upon the pillar top.

a small circle has been carved out of it, allowing it to be hung by it's rope.

Greetings and welcome to the fine city of Karthay,

We are glad you have come to visit our thriving city and hope you will
tour the many sights we have to offer. New visitors to the city may
to start their journey at the docks to the east. Situated in a
picturesque bay at the mouth of the Turbidus Ocean our merchant navy
has helped make us a contending force in commerce in the eastern
realms to rival even Palanthas' glory. We also invite you to tour the
Lord's Estate situated in the northern center of our growing town to
marvel at the opulence and elegance that is Karthay.

But save your coin, for in the shops of Karthay the finest products in
the whole of Ansalon can be found. Armourers, letherworkers and
weaponsmiths offering quality blades and clothing for the man at arms
are just the beginning. We also have shops catering to the needs of
young magi and the treasured clerics of our gods. If you have come
not only to see but to learn and improve yourself as well we boast some
of the most esteemed trainers and teachers this side of Krynn.

So welcome: to the adventure, the excitement, the growth that is 
the new Karthay.
