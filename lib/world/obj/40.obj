mud muddy~
   Years of debris and buildup have caused a soft, muddy bottom of this pond.
A nourishing euphoria has caused the life in this pond to thrive.  A random
assortment of decaying foliage from the forest above, and random sized rocks
also is included in the mixture of this pond's floor.  If the light hits the
bottom depths just in the right time, something rather odd with a slight shine
can catch the eye of a swimmer.
