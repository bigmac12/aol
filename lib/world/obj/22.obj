&ga deep green leather jerkin with emerald-studded straps&n~
A leather jerkin which has been dyed an emerald green lies here unused.~
   This band of metal is fashioned into a coronet.  The gold has been polished
until it has become as reflective as a mirror.  In its center of it there is
one of the clearest diamonds you have ever seen.  It seems to catch the light
reflecting off the coronet and hold it within itsself.

loincloth gold golden~
   Made for wrapping about the waist and shielding parts of the body which are
not meant for public viewing, this golden cloth is beautiful in make and
design.  Shimmering like a gold coin, it captures the light about it twisting
it to shine beautifully.  It has been designed so as to comfortably wrap the
waist of its wearer.

   This shirt of mail is extremely lightweight and shaped so that only those of
elven blood would be able to fit into it.  Upon a close examination the dark
metal pieces seem to be scratched here and there but when the shirt is laid
flat and looked at from a distance it becomes evident that the scratches were
intentional.  When the light reflects just so off these scratches the image of
a great tree with a set of balancing scales superimposed on it comes clear.

surrounds the thing, drawing all attention directly to it, and to the tome that

something recorded within that you are going to need to know.

key delicate crystal black~
   The key is intricate, delicate, and beautiful.  It is forged from a single
piece of odd, opaque black crystal.  Though very ornate, the key doesn't seem
to offer any clues on its own of where it might be used.  Given all the
keyholes on Krynn, and the fact that this key could open any number of locks, a
lot of trial and error lies ahead for any who wish to "unlock" the secrets of
the key.  The only clue you can discern is that the key smells faintly of
trees.
