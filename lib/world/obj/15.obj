hood grey oversized~
   This hood has been generously cut from colorless, grey cotton.  Clasps on
the back of the hood allow it to be attached to a cloak or cape.  Though
unadorned, it seems to be a fine garment.  It looks to have been treated with
some agent to help waterproof it.  When raised the hood would obscure nearly
the entire face of even the largest of humanoids.

following pages you will find information on the individual classes or robes of
mages as well as whatever information is known about the gods of each color
robe.  Please continue to page 2 to read about the white robe mages of
Solinari.    
~
E
2 two solinari white page.2~
   This section is dedicated to the mages of the white robes who follow the god
Solinari.  These mages believe in good magic, and that magic should not be used
selfishly.  They are pure of heart and have been known to give council to the
Knights of Solamnia though they are a seperate organization entirely.  They are
the most trusted of all magi as they are loyal and do not lie easily.  They
have been called the knights of the magical realms.  Though they and the
Knights of Solamnia do not mix well, their histories are not seperate.  The
white robes helped the Knights stand against the attacks of Galas Dracos during
the last dragon war.  There is also a tower of magic in the city of the
Knights, Palanthas.  Though, slow in gaining power, the white robes ultimately
wield the most power of the other two robes in the conclave.  Their god,
Solinari, has also been known to work closely with Lunitari, the goddess of the
red robe mages and the red moon.  The two classes have worked together and have
both helped the Knights during the last Dragon War.  Solinari is a patient and
forgiving god, his followers report, but he will punish those who abuse powers
he gives them.  For more information the red robes, please continue to page 3,
for the black robes, continue to page 4, and for the grey robes or renegades,
please continue to page 5.    
~
E
page.3 3 red lunitari~
   The magi of the red robes are the most free of the mages.  They have a
larger choice of spells to cast, as well as actions and choices as long as they
help to maintain the balance between good and evil.  Because of this, the red
robes usually produce the more famous of the magi, such as the mage, Magius.  
Though more liberal with their actions, the red robes have to becarefull more
so than the other orders as it is easy for them to sway to evil, or good if
they misact.  Many red robe mages have let their actions carry to far and ended
up in the embrace of Nuitari and his order.  The red robes report that their
goddess, Lunitari, is a vivacious, and carefree goddess.  She is kind, and
loves magic of all sorts, especially that of illusional spells.  She is less
likely to punish than her two cousins, but if angered, she has a fiery temper
that is best not seen.  Though, we have found no red robes who could testify to
her temper, which leads us to believe it has been quite some time since she
last was angered.    
~
E
page.4 4 nuitari black~
   The mages of the black robe have a very free existence as long as they try
to promote the magic of Nuitari before all others and do not abuse their
powers.  The black robes were an unexpected help during the last dragon war,
helping Huma Dragonbane to find his friend Magius, as well as helping to defeat
Galas Dracos.  It is not known if Nuitari punished his followers for causing
the defeat of his mother, Takhisis, but it is speculated that he did not as
Galas was a Grey Robe, and therefore a renegade.  The black robes are evil and
some are very nasty and brutal.  Most do not bother with toying with those in
their power, but gain the information needed, then dispatch them to their god
or goddess.  Nuitari is a very jealous and unforgiving god.  He is quick to
punish either failure or betrayal.  He will punish his followers quicker than
any others.    
~
E
page.5 5 grey~
   The Grey Robes are the most feared of the mages.  Not submitting themselves
to the rule of the conclave, and using their magic to ends that even the Black
Robes find dispecable, they are branded as renegades.  When a renegade is
discovered, the conclave sends a mage or a group of magi out to deal with the
renegade by either informing them to return to either join the conclave, or
submit to it's judgement.  What happens after that depends on both parties.  
If the Renegade refuses to do either, the mage may bind him with spells, or, in
the the case of the Black Robes, just kill him.  Renegade magi are considered a
hazard to all because of their lack of care for everyone.  They are hunted not
only by the Conclave, but by just about every other guild as well.  Minotaur
and Knights have teamed up to destory renegades.  Rangers have laid traps in
their forests to capture them.  They are not tolerated well in society in
general.  Mages are generally distrusted, and the renegades are distrusted and
hated.

book crown 1 page.1~
   This book contains information about the order in the Knights of Solamnia
known as the Knights of the Crown.  The Knights of the Crown are the living
embodiment of loyalty and obedience.  Knights of the Crown view loyalty as a
tribute to be justly and voluntarily rendered.  The Order of the Crown is loyal
to the order's founding god, Habbakuk, to those who suffer under evil's weight,
and to rulers who, by decree of the Knightly Council, deserve the knights'
loyalty and protection.  Only rulers who follow the tenets of Good are
deserving-- politics does not sway this decision.  The list of approved rulers
is called the List of Loyalty.  Obedience is the practical manifestation of
loyalty.  A Knight of the Crown must unquestioningly obey those on the List of
Loyalty.  The specific responsibilities of a Knight of the Crown include
tithing income, aiding any knight who requires help, and service to the nations
on the List of Loyalty
To read the list of ranks for the Knights of the Crown, please continue

book knight sword page.1~
   The purpose of this book is to enlighten the reader as to the ideals and
standards required for a Knight of the Sword in the Knights of Solamnia.  The
Knights of the Sword act as warriors for the gods of Good, upholding the purest
ideals of heroism and courage.  Heroism is self-sacrificial fight for the cause
of Good.  Heroic deeds include strengthening the weak, enriching the poor,
freeing the enslaved, exonerating the falsely accused, championing the
defenseless, and aiding fellow knights in need.  Courage is readiness to die
honorably in the fight for Good.  Courageous acts include facing evil
fearlessly, defending the honor of the Knighthood, defending the honor of a
fellow knight, and protecting the defenseless and weak.  A Knight of the Sword
must surrender all personal wealth to the knightly coffers (save what is needed
for upkeep), pay homage to Kiri-Jolith and the gods of Good each day, eagerly
engage evil opponents in combat (not retreating regardless of the enemy's
strength), protect the weak and defenseless, and forswear use of knightly
powers for unrighteous reasons.

knight rose book~
   This book is to inform people of the standards and ideals a Knight of the
Rose must follow in the Knights of Solamnia.  The Order of the Rose embraces
honor guided by justice and wisdom.  Honor is allegiance to one's Oath to
defend the cause of Good.  Honorable deeds include sacrificing oneself for the
sake of others, refusing to surrender to or ally with an evil foe, defending
the knighthood to the death, protecting the lives of fellow knights and living
true to the Oath in all matters.  Justice is the heart of the Measure and the
soul of a Rose Knight: to render everyone--creature, person, or god--his or her
due.  Just acts include aiding those who are less fortunate, donating all
wealth to the knightly coffers (except what is needed for personal or parochial
upkeep), worshipping and obeying Paladine and the gods of Good, fighting
injustice with courage, and commitment, and seeign that no life is wasted or
sacrificed in vain.  Wisdom is the prudent use of one's abilities and resources
to uphold honor and render justice.

Attire.
     Now, once you have been bathed and annointed with a suitable perfume, your next
decision must be what to wear. This will vary widely based on the planned activities.
Be sure, when chosing you attire, to take into account the weather (hot or cold, dry or
rainy), the planned activities (dancing, riding, shopping, dinner) and the current
fashion or style. Nothing will make a worse impression then appearing at the Lord's
ball in last seasons finery.

Perfume.
     When making an appearance, be it at a courtly ball or simply a market square, ones
aroma is extremely important. It will arrive before you and stay after you have left. To
ensure that your aroma is pleasant and enjoyable you must first complete the instructions
on bathing found in the first chapter of this manual. Once that has been done, you should
select a perfume that has a light pleasing aroma to it. Too strong a perfume and you will
overwhelm the nose of the ones you are trying to make a good impression on. Too weak and
it will be unnoticeable.

Bathing.
     One of the most important things needed to make a good impression on others is
cleanliness. Frequent and consistant bathing will help ensure cleanliness. Bathing
removes the normal daily dirt and grime that even the most pampered person will still
accumulate throughout the day.
     To bath properly, place a large volume of heated water in a container which is large
enough to hold the body of the bather. Then apply a quantity of soap or pumace to the
entire body. Rinse the body after doing this with another volume of clean heated water.
