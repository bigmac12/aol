shell giant insect breastplate crafted thick black carapace~
   This is the shell of some large insect, which has been cleaned and shaped
into the form of a breastplate.  It is very thick, and offers excellent
protection for those who do not mind wearing a part of an insect corpse on
their person.  The surface of the armor is rather oily-looking, causing light
that shines on it to reflect in a variety of colors.  The armor itself is a
dull olive-green color.  Certainly not the most attractive of attire, but one
favored by many warriors for the impression it makes.
