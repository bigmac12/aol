including a solamnic helmet.  It stands here, likely propped up on some sort of
a dummy.  A huge two-handed sword is clutched in the mailed hands of the
statue, making it appear as though it were a knightly sentry, standing forever
on guard.  The armor is beautifully engraved with all the markings one would
expect of a full suit of ceremonial Solamnic armor.  You can see on the
breastplate the symbols of all three orders, though one stands out more
prominently than the others, that being the order that the owner of the armor
would have belonged to.

thing of beauty.  The tapestry shows four distinct scenes in each of its four
quarters.  In the first, the scene is that of a young man leaving home to join
the knights.  The second scene is the young squire earning his spurs.  The
third is a scene of a young knight going into his first battle, against a
terrible ogre.  And the last picture is a scene showing the young man being
returned home in honour on his shield.  It is bleak, but it is a testimony to
each of the knights serving here, that each would give his life in the cause of
justice.  The cloth is brocaded, giving each scene a three-dimensional feel.

   "In 313 of our current age, Lord Tairus Pollinson commanded the third army
of the Knights of Solamnia in a campaign against hobgoblins to the south.  His
army was ambushed, and most of his men were slaughtered.  Facing an impossible
choice, and every day losing more men to sickness and injury, he did as any
true knight would do.  He delivered a stirring speach to his men, stirring
their very souls, and led one last charge against the hobgoblins.  Though the
charge was a success, and the few hobgoblin survivors were driven into flight,
Lord Tairus himself was killed in the initial onslaught.  Though he did not
live to see the outcome of the battle, his courage and dignity are still
remembered to this day.  It is because of his actions, and his speech which is
still the object of study by scholars, that this statue was commissioned in
323, on the tenth anniversary of his last battle.  Pray for him, and honour his
memory."

for those seeing it for the first time, it is quite impressive.  There is an

stole ocean blue thick collar habbakuk~
   Also called an orarium, the origins of this ceremonial scarf are both
secular, in the sense that it provided warmth, and sacred, in that it is an
essential part of the burial shrouds of many cultures.  This particular stole
is a bit more than a simple scarf, and is actually closer to what some might
assume is a mantle.  It appears as though this stole was designed specifically
to be worn over a robe.  It is a rich, ocean-blue in color, and a subtle
wave-like pattern has been stitched into it in a slightly lighter shade.  One
might not even notice it unless they looked directly at the garment.  The stole
bears a high collar, which is trimmed with ivory edging to accent it.  Two long
strips of cloth extend from the mantle, hanging down the front of the wearer
and ending at the knees.

   These robes are made of a light white fabric and drape gently over the
shoulders.  They tumble approximately down to the shins of the one wearing
them.  The cuffs and collar, as well as the lower helm is embroidered with
silver thread.  Upon the back is borne the symbol of Paladine, signifying the
ultimate ownership of this article, as well as the one wearing it.

mithril spear glittering~
   A long, vallenwood shaft is tipped with a sharp, two-foot spearhead made
entirely out of mithril.  Mithril as it is is rare beyond rare, and to see this
much of it put into a single weapon is almost unheard-of.  The weapon is
beautifully made, clearly the work of a master craftsman.  In the hands of a
skilled warrior, it can be used defensively as well, blocking attacks as one
would with a quarterstaff.  The staff is extremely lightweight, and it seems to
almost vibrate with some sort of energy.

girdle giant strength leather wide~
   Girdles are the items most commonly enchanted with strength-enhancing magic.
This girdle would seem to be no exception.  It radiates with power that can be
felt simply by touching it.  However, it feels unnaturally heavy, especially
considering the apparently mundane nature of the leather used in it.  In fact,
the only unusual looking thing about the belt are the rows of tiny silver studs
that line it.  Upon close inspection, these are mithril, which is exceedingly
rare.  A nice piece of work all in all, though it is likely not one of the
stronger, so-called "Girdles of Giant Strength".  A few large rings, also
mithril, hang from the side of the belt, allowing one to hang objects from it.

   This lance has been crafted masterfully by a skilled weaponsmith.  Though
generally used by mounted knights on horseback, it can also be used albeit with
some difficulty by footmen.  It is about ten feet long from end to tip, and
made of shining polished steel.  The end is sharply pointed, barbed for the
most damage potential.  The first two feet of the lance are gripped with
leather bindings for holding, and weighted for balance.

   The armor worn by the ranking Knights of Solamnia is among the finest in the
land, though not the finest that money can buy, as no amount of cash will
purchase one.  They are given to deserving warriors within the knighthood:
those who have proven their worth on the field of battle and shown their
worthiness as knights.  This suit of armor is beautifully crafted and polished
to a high shine.  Although all three symbols of the knighthood are present, the
Sword, Rose, and crown, the most prominently displayed is the symbol of the
Sword.

   This helmet is truly a marvel.  It is made of bronze that is polished to a
high shine.  It is bullet-shaped, and open-faced, though a visor could easily
be added to it.  Its truely remarkable feature, however, is the presence of two
white wings, like those of a hawk on either side of the helmet.  The feathers
are not delicate at all, and would stand up to even the roughest combat.  The
feathers have an odd shine to them, indicating that perhaps they belong to a
creature of something more than a mundane nature.  The helmet also seems to be
enchanted in some way.

   Bearded axes have a wider blade that hangs partway down the shaft, giving it
a longer cutting edge.  This axe's blade is flat-edged and sharp, made for
cleaving rather than slashing.  The blade is nicely crafted out of strong
steel, and has been etched with relief patterns depicting a dwarf and knight
cooperating to defeat an ogre.  It is likely that this axe too is a product of
such an alliance between a dwarven craftsman and a Solamnic weaponsmith.

These blades can also trap and block weapons, or catch and hold an opponent.

   This flail looks like that used by horsemen.  The shaft is lengthened to
about three feet, allowing plenty of room to grasp onto, and giving the weapon
a bit of added range as well.  This shaft is attached to a long chain, and
mounted on this chain are three spiked balls which would whip an enemy rather
than crush him.  The weapon is of little use against opponents armed with
platemail, though the damage to more lightly armed foes is considerable.

time, and only three or four really good fights or workout sessions stand
between this cutlass and its eventual destiny as a perfectly useable weapon.  
The edge is incredibly sharp.  Its light weight makes it an ideal second-hand
weapon for those flashy sorts who prefer having a sword in each hand.
