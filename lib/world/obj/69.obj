robe long bone white~
   This floor-length robe fits loosely upon the body of the wearer, and its
white colour is not so much the pure white of driven snow or of a mother's
milk, but is instead the sickly, death-like white of a dried bone.  The collar
and hems of the garment have been stitched with a repetitive pattern of a
broken scale, though one has to look very closely to see that pattern.
