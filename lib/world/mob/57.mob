A Knight of the Crown guards this entrance.
~
   This knight is of the order of the crown.  He dutifully guards the southern
entrance into and out of the Knight's Spur, thus protecting Palanthas, and the
road to it.  His mustache is newly started, and is not as grand as other
Knights, but the determined look in his eyes prove that he will fight just as
fiercly if needed.
