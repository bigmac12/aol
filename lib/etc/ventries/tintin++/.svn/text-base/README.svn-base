Welcome to TinTin++ v1.5!
-------------------------

This is the Official Release of v1.5.  Please read over the documentation
and the Makefile before reporting problems.  Enjoy it

SunOS users:  Don't forget to remove the # in the Makefile for F2 
(-DDIRTY_REDEFINE)

SYSV users (IRIX, SolarisOS, etc.):  If you get errors in the 
echo.c file during compilation, don't forget to uncomment F3, (F4 is optional)
and some OS's like F5 being uncommented.

If the install script didn't copy the help files to your home directory, they 
can be found in tintin++/src/support/.tt_help.txt.Z

All bug reports should be sent to:   reiss@ritchie.acomp.usf.edu
All mail will get forwarded to the devel team.
