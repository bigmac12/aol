How to install Tintin++v1.5.
enter the correct bin/tintin lib directories in src/Makefile.in. 
Change current directory to the src dir and type './configure'.
Type 'make depend' followed by 'make all'. Hopefully this will compile
the program without errors. If anything goes wrong, change in Makefile.in
and not the generated Makefile. After such a change you should do
'config.status' to remake the Makefile. You might need to do 'make clean'
before you continue building the program.

By typing in 'make install' you will install the binary and the helpfile
in the directories you entered in 'Makefile.in'.
