Chemosh  (Dec 31) [ 1204] that is a stupid idea
Rollin   (Dec 31) [10055] Another idea ... I do not think the shop owners should puke on you if you do not have enough money I think it is rather unlikly of them figuring that we could go anywhere to buy stuff.

Duros    (Feb 24) [ 9823] I am kinda new on this mud, but I noticed there is no spell listing.  It would be kind of nice to know what spells are available, and at what level you have to be to get them.  It doesnt have to be like Fireball 3   It could be Fireball, This spell

Chemosh  (Mar 13) [ 1204] it would be nice if you weren't such an idiot you stat raping moron.
Malryk   (Mar 14) [ 8104] It would be best if you only lost 25% of your experience points instead of half.
Natasha  (Mar 19) [ 7086] hungry and thirsty less often.
Natasha  (Mar 19) [10172] an inn for prolonged absences
Solinari (Mar 19) [ 1204] teach people the diff between inputting an idea and a bug.
Takhisis (Mar 19) [ 1199] Just live with it and shut up!
Paladine (Mar 19) [ 1204] *wiggle*
Paladine (Mar 19) [ 1204] Don't ask what kind of idea that was.  My mind works in mysterious ways.
Nuitari  (Mar 19) [ 1216] Nuitari is going to make Paladine go through and sift through the bug and idea files for useful information :-)
Paladine (Mar 19) [ 1204] *wouldn't mind going through the files, actually, if it meant some of the stuff had a chance of getting done ;)*
Nuitari  (Mar 19) [ 1216] *thinks we need to make the socials do "coding" duty rotation :-)
Takhisis (Mar 19) [ 1199] Thinks that would be a disaster!
Zivilyn  (Mar 19) [ 1199] cancel that idea, we couldnt afford the downtime do to bugs they would make :P
Paladine (Mar 19) [ 1204] *laugh*  ...maybe if Mandrake would install!

Chemosh  (Mar 29) [ 1050] let ME do the socials *grin*
Quizon   (Mar 30) [ 9805] palming skill for rouges so if they get disarmed or lose their weapon they have another one or just to hide their current weapon so no one knows what they wield

Solinari (Mar 30) [ 1204] Cloak/uncloak command.  If you don't know hwat i mean, you're an idiot.
Natasha  (Mar 31) [ 9849] help, minotaurs are too tough.
Alaric   (Apr  4) [ 1928] I think that the "TRY" command should instead of saying 'You try out a <item>" It should say like where on your body you try it out on.  EX.  "you try out a <item> on your <body place>  thank ye! :)
Zivilyn  (Apr  4) [ 1199] most people know where they wear stuff at
Zivilyn  (Apr  4) [ 1199] boggle

Zeboim   (Apr  5) [ 1204] After you appoint me Supereme Empress and Ruler of all Krynn
Gavin    (Apr  5) [ 3974] Make horses available and make a 'ride' command that Paladins, Knights, Warrirors etc can use to ride horses.  Good idea? :)
Retain   (Apr  5) [ 9801] Stress that even that mob killing is ooc that you shouldn't kill things while other people are there like if somone says hi to you you just don't say hi then kill somthing..
Alaric   (Apr  6) [ 7061] me tinks der should be a stretch command, EX <player> stretches his arms and legs....but better then that. :) Me hope ye understand if not ask me!! :)
Angus    (Apr  7) [10063] I think there should be a way to view your short description, like add on to the Whoami command.  Add what your short des is. ok thanks :)
Crizen   (Apr  9) [ 8500] social of stretch
Crizen   (Apr  9) [ 8525] heh, this is complex...  special containers, only can hold certain things (gem pouch, map case, sword sheath)
Lunitari (Apr  9) [ 1998] Make the approval thing beep or page them or something - they dont seem to understand they are approved when it says 'You have been approved'
Peregorn (Apr  9) [10157] broadsword
Solinari (Apr  9) [ 1204] the previous idea sent in by peregorn was an accident.

Alaric   (Apr 10) [ 1944] i think that if ye be fighting a thief in town, and a guard walk in on it he shouldn't attack ye, cause ye be cleanin out the streets of tieves...
Paladine (Apr 10) [ 1204] Guards like to kill...  deal.  ;)  And you shouldn't kill thieves, anyhow
Zeboim   (Apr 10) [ 1204] why not?
Paladine (Apr 10) [ 1204] Because they're nice
Zeboim   (Apr 10) [ 1204] Personally, I prefer drowning them. I like watching them suffer 0=)
Shinare  (Apr 10) [ 7061] bahh, guards could have more discretion :p
Zeboim   (Apr 10) [ 1204] I'll drown the guards too - make it a party, bring the rubber ducky.

Chemosh  (Apr 11) [ 1199] You sick pervert
Lurkin   (Apr 12) [ 7307] I think that for days the should take a bit longer cause I know people needs it to go fast to heal and such and paladins lay hands but when you think about around 50 days go by in 1 day of real life
Akali    (Apr 13) [ 9826] lose move points during combat? prevents constant fighting, or walking around fighting. cant fight if 'too tired'
Alaric   (Apr 13) [ 1900] if you are fighting a thief and a guard sees you, the guard should not interfear, ye be doing their job, killen the thieves... they shouldn't jump in and kill you for trying to kill a thief.
Kras     (Apr 15) [ 2041] i have an idea, but i dont know if its already been put into effect
Brock    (Apr 15) [ 2255] no need shield bash... just use arm.  Brock like bash.
Brock    (Apr 16) [ 7239] More travelers on Merchant Highway...  Supposed be busy highway.
Brock    (Apr 17) [ 1946] when trying items instead of just saying it is usable.  Say where 'You try a tunic on your body, it seems quite usable' 'You wield and hold a silver dagger, it seems quite usable.'
Paladine (Apr 22) [ 1224] zlist: displays what rooms have zedits, and a short version of what's loaded in each room.  Perhaps cut off after a few lines.  Would be useful for adding new items and mobs so you can raise the limits

Zivilyn  (May  1) [ 1204] no, i dont want a flood of requests for "private" boards for ever single little group in the game *chuckles*
Dalizar  (May  1) [ 2395] Make mob flags to assist based upon alignment, so that certain mobs will only assist certain other mobs.

Wren     (May  6) [ 6608] Main street's desc says 'pplalong the streets sell everything from weapons to armor, food and drinks'  suggest adding a few shops that actually does that. Only have the inn (that i saw)
Natasha  (May  7) [ 7136] Shared light sources for groups travelling together.
Brock    (May  7) [ 2815] dual wield only makes sense to use against non-bashable beings...  why need shield to bash?
Tvashtri (May  7) [ 2396] make keys in areas crumble so that they can repop, rather than never repop in two days *wink*

Tvashtri (May  8) [10063] nods and casts all she wants because peeps arnt talking, when i was busy talking with you?
Nanz     (May  9) [ 9871] It would be nice to see a command that lets you see every skill of your own profession
Nanz     (May  9) [10075] How about an 'unalias' command?
Crastin  (May 10) [10058] make it so clerics can't cast darkness at certain places like where you sell things ... cause that is annoying and probly the guards would end up dealing with them..
Wren     (May 11) [ 1900] for mages' 5th elemental--Pure Magic.
Kras     (May 12) [ 6182] i think age should be added to score
Kras     (May 12) [ 6182] maybe something could be added to track so that it can be used to link aliases of mobs or players. ie. if a mob has aliases a,b, and c, it can be tracked by typing track a b c or something similar
Ravihn   (May 12) [ 9753] How about a "mercy" command for PK, so when you get the "A smuggler is incapacitated and will slowly die, if not aided." message you can type mercy and than you can loot there corpse or something like that...dunno, just an idea
Takhisis (May 12) [ 1204] like the submit skill ... I like it!
Reorx    (May 12) [ 1998] otherwise known as subdue, hidd and i have thought of it and it is in our manifesto
Takhisis (May 12) [ 1204] Reo rules!
Takhisis (May 12) [ 1204] Hidd too
Tvashtri (May 12) [ 4343] need xsocials for us more mature pc's
Kras     (May 13) [ 1900] fix backstab so that it doesn't automatically target the last person who entered the room if you dont type in a target
Shinorah (May 13) [ 9902] should be able to ruffle ppl's hair while resting
Shinorah (May 13) [ 9902] Hmmm - I cringe to suggest this, but maybe we should have an ooc room/inn for ppl who want to chat outside of game, could possibly get rid of the need for the ooc tell? just a thought
Tvashtri (May 13) [10063] fix the mail so we dont try to read our eq heeh

Chemosh  (May 18) [ 1204] come up here and I'll prove I exist :P
Wren     (May 18) [10063] sure sure..
Varian   (May 18) [ 2922] for one supposedly sent to the abyss, it's easy to see which god has the most power still...

Zivilyn  (May 18) [ 1199] fuck you
Chemosh  (May 18) [ 1204] take the idea command from ziv...he's lost it

Zivilyn  (May 18) [ 1199] fuck chem
Chemosh  (May 18) [ 1204] ziv...I think you are a little confused...you want a woman..not me you pinko
Rishandal (May 18) [10063] give ziv a bottle of whiskey..he'll be drinking and unable to talk
Zivilyn  (May 18) [ 1199] i am 
Rishandal (May 18) [10063] ziv's talking too much...who let his drink go empty
Sargonnas (May 18) [ 1169] so fix it
Sargonnas (May 18) [ 1169] ok
Chemosh  (May 18) [ 1204] make sargonnas wear a pink tutu and dance in the square like the fairy he is.
Sargonnas (May 18) [ 1169] then chem will get a woody
Chemosh  (May 18) [ 1204] that's pal you're thinking of, Sarg.  He's the one that polishes his lance.
Sargonnas (May 18) [ 1169] go through that log and change all the ziv names and chem names and switch them around and post them on the mudconnector
Sargonnas (May 18) [ 1169] take the red wig away from messy and make chem get a different bitch

Lan      (May 27) [ 1998] alright this is simple, have a shortened emote thing like : for it so people find it easier to use emotes for RP, hard part is making the color when they put quotes around what they say butnthen if you do that people can make what they say and expre
Lan      (May 27) [ 1998] RP experience, less reliance on code combat and more RP.  Its a strength and by spliting RP with code combat it kinda ruins the atmosphere, why exactly would a druid have to kill bunny wabbits to level, isnt that a bit out of character?
Lan      (May 27) [10063] ive said this before and ill say it again, oh Xan/Gurp here :P, have item alias so i dont need to type full names, its really become a common feature on other muds :P
Plandra  (May 27) [10172] Anyone there?

Kras     (May 28) [ 1900] maybe put in a spell or skill that removes invisiblity from an object
Kras     (May 29) [ 2099] when trying an item in a store, instead of "It seems quite useable", maybe replace it with "It fits <body part> well." and if it can be worn on more than 1 body part, it tells that as well.
Linden   (May 29) [ 6029] I'm too smart to be a warrior!  Need more skills... *grin*
Kras     (May 30) [ 1920] instead of getting "You are affected by the following spells:" it would make more sense if with something like "These are your affections:"
Kras     (May 31) [ 1900] i think a command to stop sneaking would be great because there are times when someone might want to stop sneaking
Kras     (Jun  3) [ 6269] i think really powerful agressive mobs in locked rooms with 1 exit should be easier
Kras     (Jun  3) [ 6269] maybe make each eyewing load a stone so that one doesn't get their bodies stuck in the room that the key is needed for?
Mesh     (Jun  8) [ 2373] how about when you already have a spell affection, when you affected by the spell again such as blur once, its not over and you blur again, that the effect become renewed. i.e. blur for 2 hours(it lasts 3) then before the spell duration ends, you bl

Crizen   (Jun 10) [10075] DARKNESS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE CAST ON A ROOM, and if so it should have a limit on how long it lasts...
Natasha  (Jun 10) [ 4744] to discourage powerful items littered around, award an xp bonus for any item sacrificed in the fire.  The higher level item, the greater the bonus.  This will discourage carelessness, and reward the consciencious.
Mesh     (Jun 16) [ 2340] a good idea would be to add an automatic save whenever you rent.
Natasha  (Jun 18) [ 2394] how about a "stretch" social?
Wungar   (Jun 22) [ 2377] have a stat command so you can view your stats during the game jsut incase you need them for referance nd forgot/lost them 
Tivanosa (Jun 23) [ 9800] "backstab" should work on opponents who are fighting others, but not you.  As is, backstab can only be used by the first person to attack, and thieves are usually not strong enough to tank!
Crimson  (Jun 24) [ 2304] you my want to institute racial based skill such as gore for minotaurs or sneak, hide and steal for kender

Goldfinch (Jun 29) [ 7253] rofl
Natasha  (Jun 30) [10063] a lot of people take "look"s the wrong way.  How about haveing the "Look" message appear only to the looker?
Natasha  (Jun 30) [ 7024] maybe a second slot for light source?  Having only one makes it hard for beings without infravision to change a dting lantern in the dark.

Tivanosa (Jul  2) [ 1921] XP bonus when a mob runs away from you?
Natasha  (Jul  4) [ 8006] lay on hands should work while fighting
Takhisis (Jul  5) [ 1204] bite social
Tivanosa (Jul  6) [10063] Not technically an idea, but What are scripts?  All I know is that you get punished if you use them to gain xp, but how can I avoid that if I don't know what they are?
Natasha  (Jul  8) [ 7025] how about more weak monster and undead mobs?  like goblins or zombies or something like that?
Ryszard  (Jul  8) [ 9848] gods should still be visable in the WHO list when in darkness.
Keyla    (Jul  8) [10063] help files on different alignments as a guidline?

Natasha  (Jul 10) [ 7168] larger bank of intros, cuz they keep getting lost.
Zivilyn  (Jul 10) [ 1204] stop introing everyone in the world then
Wren     (Jul 11) [ 8103] get rid of vomit (shopkeeper vomit on player if they broke)
Brock    (Jul 11) [ 2587] Your rules for making chars (useable aliases) same needs to go for items and mobs.  So you know you are conning the right one.
Natasha  (Jul 12) [10159] Interest on funds put in the bank?
Natasha  (Jul 12) [ 9967] Bonus xps for helping out newbies! :)
Natasha  (Jul 14) [ 7246] How about a warning BEFORE it gets dark?  Right now it always comes as a bit of a surprise.
Chemosh  (Jul 14) [ 1204] how about typing time
Mishakal (Jul 14) [ 1002] Chem needs to get a life
Chemosh  (Jul 14) [ 1204] Mish needs to pay up, I bought her that damn happy meal
Natasha  (Jul 14) [ 2248] How about hitting Lavitz with a large flaming stone?
Natasha  (Jul 16) [10063] How about a Player graveyard near Kalaman?  With the names of some more notable players who've "passed on"?

Kyndra   (Jul 17) [10063] Give people who help newbies a little exp or something, to give us insentive :)
Kaledda  (Jul 19) [10063] Please, put in a skill that allows you to change your short desc temp. For thieves ;)
Natasha  (Jul 19) [10140] a vault for storing surplus items, could charge rent like the inn, but would allow for a greater range of outfits! :)
Natasha  (Jul 19) [ 1900] Intros are being lost WAY too often!
Mosoccah (Jul 20) [10063] Female-specific armor.  I think some of my female Fighters would really appreciate it.
