Valdric  (Apr  8) [ 2414] room triggers for the various 'shows' in kendermore
Tiffanie (Apr  8) [ 9973] there should be more pairs of panites on this mud one for each day of the week and maybe throw in some pairs of boxers for the boys ;)
Johnathan (Apr 10) [11123] Conjuring Greater Elementals (with the skill at superb) should have a higher success rate than the 33% that it seems to average.
Johnathan (Apr 11) [ 1006] Purge Telamon for gassing up Nuitari's laboratory.
Felix    (Apr 12) [ 9835] Would be really super neat if their was like a pan flute that casted charm. I know that I think saytrs charmed people into dancing with them with their flutes.. Just thought its cool idea =D

Darren   (Apr 12) [ 6213] 'a snowy white velvet sash' and 'a midnight black velvet sash' to go along with 'a blood-red, velvet sash'
Bryant   (Apr 12) [10140] Make it so there is some cost for sneaking 24/7.  Like extra movement or something, that way people won't just sneak all the time.  Really hard to sneak out of a tavern when people are staring at oyu.
Bryant   (Apr 12) [10140] Have people put their race some where in their description, that way people know how to rp with them.
Niros    (Apr 12) [ 4142] Make Pileus, the tavern owner in morning dew, be able to buy the rum he sells.
Sarika   (Apr 14) [ 5286] the mop at the trading post i think a monk should be able to wield it since it is nothing magical plus it would be great rp
Wade     (Apr 23) [11021] For the guard skill - Have players able to guard exits like blocker mobs.
Narissa  (Apr 28) [ 2229] sanitarium to lock up nutzoid characters
Narissa  (Apr 29) [ 5389] make some mushrooms in the wild have hallucenagenic sp? properties
Farlin   (May 21) [11218] give an extra incentive to "flight", my idea is allowing flying players to automatically flee (or much greater chance) when fighting a non-flying opponent
Narissa  (May 24) [ 6111] make the bandages into a wand to be able to use on someone, if someone is badly injured, they're not going to be able to bandage themselves and only a few races/classes get the bandage skill
Farlin   (Jun  3) [11248] freeze time spell, instead of freezing time, you give it three spell names as the parameters and it casts all three of them using only the lag and display message of casting the freeze time spell.  If less than 3 spells were given, a round of combat could be dealt by the caster for each additional slot that was free.
Kendrall (Jun  4) [ 2308] Fist of E'li. See http://www.dl3e.com/rules/display.asp?id=11346 for details.

Kendrall (Jun  4) [ 2316] for more items/weapons, check out www.seanreynolds.com/rpgfiles/magicitems/dragonlance.html
Normand  (Jun 10) [ 5082] make it so people can't see when they look at you, it just spams the players and would be hard to notice unless somone stared at you.
Normand  (Jun 11) [ 5111] make ticks come faster, or people heal more...so at laters it doesn't take 5 years to fully heal
Normand  (Jun 11) [ 5111] Or even give all fighter class a skill of faster healing.
Hitori   (Jun 13) [ 5082] Ok, here's my idea. When you whistle, shouldn't it be heard a few rooms away, or maybe there should be a 'sharp whistle' command. It's kinda hard for a mute to shout at someone. Not to mention not everyone wants to shout a message acrossed town at people. Just an idea, if you like you're welcome, if you don't like, let me know so I can redo my thinking path.
Orlin    (Jun 17) [ 8127] me tinks dat der should be some eq that has rearx stuff on it! *pouts* haven't found anything yet that has....*pout* no armor or nothing....*pout* but if ye could make some.....*beams at the idea* that would be great!!

Karak    (Jul  4) [10138] Set intros as 'on' by default.

Shalandea (Jul 19) [ 9825] shal
Theobald (Jul 21) [ 7260] A shelter or some such in Karthay now that Istar is spreading it's influence.  Of course full of the Gods of Light gobble-d-gook.
Lunitari (Jul 23) [20099] More diverse robes for mages - Zyren's idear (not very bright, isnt he?)
Valdric  (Jul 23) [ 5103] add a decay timer for certain keys, so they're not always lying around outside their areas.
Gelsorn  (Jul 29) [ 1454] RP item, no stats- "A small bundle of arrows".
Valdric  (Jul 31) [ 5107] Have a 'replaychannel' to list messages posted over the OOC/newbie channels, 
Valdric  (Jul 31) [ 5107] 'replay' to redisplay tells, and 'replayroom' to list recent actions in RP.
Grevan   (Jul 31) [ 1677] I've played on other muds that have had this so it's not realy my idea but clerics of the same alinment healed players and casted spells of there lvl on thim auto whin asked by a player just though it would be something to look in to mabe. :)
Korei    (Aug  3) [ 7209] help
Korei    (Aug  3) [ 7209] -please void the "help" message
Tempus   (Aug  3) [ 7349] "glancing" at people allows a player to see if a person is exhausted, without movepoints (or at least close) an exhausted person irl is reasonably obvious to see
Grevan   (Aug  4) [ 7120] mabe a help file on using a warrent and how it works.
Asche    (Aug  4) [ 7800] the forest near outpost sw of thelgaard cant make a spring there mebe change that
Grevan   (Aug  5) [ 7089] ohh how about for knight who don't wana carrie around shield's all the time you give thim the skill lunge for pollarms and like hiltsmash for twohanded weapons
Valdric  (Aug  5) [ 5101] Make more nonmagical 'cloth' type equipment available to monks
Tempus   (Aug  5) [ 1979] if you can pick a lock, you can lock it back later without the key :)
Dasa     (Aug  5) [ 4754] the robes of Mishakal be colored sky blue or dark blue :-D
Tiathnes (Aug  6) [10140] shudder social
Tempus   (Aug  6) [ 5196] color ill affects on the affects list red (or any color really)
Tiathnes (Aug  7) [ 2320] Have says, emotes and socials coded to give rp xp, it would encourage players to rp more, I'm not sure it can be done with the mud's code base :P
Cefca    (Aug  8) [10175] Mining: for when/if the 128-bit code gets implemented..one could mine various gemstones and ores, for one of a 'blacksmith' class to forge into weapons and armor.
Tempus   (Aug 13) [10158] allow the gnome contraption near thelgaard to work :D send people flying...say to palanthus? or anywhere really, shortcut for some, hindrance for others
Darren   (Aug 13) [ 4715] A nifty 'wizzap' command..Use it to smite unruly players with a bolt of lighting (complete with ansi graphic), dropping their hp and mv down to 1. :)
Darren   (Aug 13) [ 4715] lightning, anyway.
Alasse   (Aug 13) [ 8538] that cows should be allowed to be ridden.
Andrik   (Aug 13) [ 3106] Sylvanesti Forest - Three messages pop up...the warning arrow, then another arrow, then you're hit. There isn't enough time to react to anything because they're so fast.
Seth     (Aug 13) [10133] mprog/room trigger that shows people arrive and leave in certain directions on the street below.
Korei    (Aug 13) [10063] a good idea, u can impale something as a skill, it take away small bits of life, but like throw, its extracted from ur inventory, so its smart to have a backup
Razlan   (Aug 13) [ 2383] when a wear slot isnt used, "Nothing" is listed, for example <worn on head>  Nothing. its similar to the "something" that is listed when an item is invisible
Zivilyn  (Aug 13) [ 1199] razlan needs to shutup so we can fix the crashes first, then he can worry about going around barefooted
Sapphire (Aug 15) [ 8534] until update at noon have ooc day!
Karioh   (Aug 15) [ 6059] Make a pail of mixed fish bait hangable on a belt, that way it can be worn while fishing.
Kendrall (Aug 15) [ 7260] would be nice to see an "improved" version of summon and teleport; i.e. "improved summoning" and "improved teleport"
Tiathnes (Aug 15) [ 4235] an object called 'a tell from an imm' 
Korei    (Aug 15) [10063] Make a command to choose to ehar the kalaman herald or not
Banazir  (Aug 22) [ 7015] commands such as mrest and dismount shouldnt need specificity to work, simply typing mrest for your steed to rest, instead of mrest stallion or mrest packhorse, etc
Banazir  (Aug 23) [ 2289] hang skins/canteens from your belt like pouches
Shia     (Aug 24) [ 5197] corset
Damion   (Aug 25) [ 5094] Make it so you can see your orginal stats when you type score, mainly for rp purposes.
Damion   (Aug 25) [ 5095] Possibly make it so every so many levels you can actually up a stat point, so your charcter actually gets better besides hitpoints, and skills for leveling
Banazir  (Aug 25) [ 7229] the animal summoning II snake should have infravision...just cause its a snake :) no clue why the monkey has it *shrug*
Banazir  (Aug 25) [ 2286] casting a spell again refreshes the spell. say a 5 tick spell, "refreshed" before it runs out, sets its length back to 5 ticks
Banazir  (Aug 26) [ 7880] change the "block" skill to "parry" or something similar, and allow different classes of player to learn "block", the kind of block certain mobs have, where they stand in your way, BLOCKing an exit
Banazir  (Aug 27) [10479] throw should be a skill for everyone, anyone can learn to throw well, or not, as the player chooses (for rp or to preserve practice sessions)
Dohray   (Aug 30) [10115] set the default wear location of shields to 'shield' instead of 'back'
Dohray   (Aug 30) [10140] have chislev do all the work, teach her a thing or two :-p
Dohray   (Aug 30) [10140] Give Chislev all the pretty things, and have the other Imms wait on her, hand and foot.
Tempus   (Sep  1) [ 4153] allow players to shred mail anywhere, I cant count the number of times Ive gotten mail, then wandered off with it. This will also keep players from just dropping it somewhere, or giving it to mobs (esp. innkeepers)
Tempus   (Sep  1) [ 3194] the "warning" arrows in the silvanesti forest shouldnt ALWAYS hit, by that I mean if you leave the room before the non-warning arrow hits, you shouldnt be hit
Takhisis (Sep  1) [ 1221] Silv are good with their bows. :P
Chemosh  (Sep  1) [19999] Ask tak
Chemosh  (Sep  1) [19999] she's been beat by them before
Damion   (Sep  2) [ 5101] Warriors should get trip, that way they could actually use two-handed weapons or two weapons and not be totaly worthless.
Damion   (Sep  2) [ 5008] Also about that trip thing, it would make it so not all warriors tended to look the same like most do now with the sword and shield.
Tempus   (Sep  3) [13082] the items thrown at players or mobs should be retrievable, from the corpse or simply lying on the ground afterwords
Tempus   (Sep  3) [13097] if it doesnt already, sneaking or hiding should greatly increase the chance of a backstab, or at least the severity of a sucessful backstab
Tempus   (Sep  3) [ 2501] if you can take the time to trip someone, you should be able to kick dirt in their eyes too
Tempus   (Sep  3) [ 2080] the codeword for the Thieves Guild should have to be whispered to Harkin, so it wont be spread around as fast (for example, if a couple of people were leveling, and the thief stopped here to buy something, the other player wouldnt all of a sudden know the word)
Wot      (Sep  4) [ 9815] able use the frying pan as a shield
Wot      (Sep  4) [ 9895] clerical mobs (at random, or maybe with proper codewords "please" etc) will cast healing spells on players. obviously, not on players that have attacked them recently
Paladine (Sep  4) [ 1204] Spell Sticks to Snakes: snakes cannot see in the dark in the game, but can function in the dark irl.  Could this be changed?
Wot      (Sep  5) [ 9804] do NOT let the knights wander the docks, or we will have newbies and lowbies dying left and right
Chemosh  (Sep  5) [19999] Slap Wot for his impertinence
Wot      (Sep  6) [ 8099] shops (ALL shops) are open 24/7, but after hours they charge an extra 50-80% for items. This way players dont have to wait 5 hours for a recall, but its still realistic (we woke up the shopkeepers to do business, they will be angry and less negotiable with prices)
Wot      (Sep  6) [ 8116] the dirty pieces of cloth that are often unearthed should be wearable, anywhere (great gully dwarf eq for low levels)
Devon    (Sep  7) [10115] when you try an item on at the shop have it show you the long description as well.
Wot      (Sep  7) [10160] have the general stores stock firewood
Alviard  (Sep  8) [10138] Bandanas of various colors and designs.
Takhisis (Sep  8) [ 1111] Can we make a shout-like command that is only heard in adjacent rooms like a deathcry is?
Wot      (Sep 13) [ 5373] when its raining, you can fill empty water containers, like real people do in times of extreme thirst :) I could use some water right about now, which is why I bring it up lol
Valate   (Sep 13) [ 5070] make it so torches or other light works through darkness, mainly because that spell only hurts humans.
Valate   (Sep 13) [ 5072] Also make it so you can't cast darkness in room squares any more... like the square of karthay
Valate   (Sep 14) [ 8126] make it so you can "draw" weapons from scabbards as well, so you don't have to remove the scabbard to get it back out.
Vadris   (Sep 19) [ 5292] Not sure sneak should operate while mounted.  Something weird about someone 'sneaking' into the room on a donkey.
Alviard  (Sep 24) [ 1920] Make the knights patrolling Palanthas a little less aggro than giving a player less then half a second to react. Even speedwalking past them gives them enough time to attack.
Karioh   (Sep 30) [10140] Item- a bath sponge
Daliroth (Oct  7) [10452] Perhaps for clerics of Chemosh at their highest level, they can make undead from corpses of mobs.
Alaudrien (Oct 16) [ 5000] hate to have a gf with parents like that
Alaudrien (Oct 16) [ 5000] eek sorry
Vadris   (Oct 18) [ 7689] Code it so that messages given when you affect a monster (say with kicks or bashes) can be customized in building from mob to mob.  Ie) The default says the same, but when building something like an amorphous glob, you can have the kick message say something different than kicking it in its nonexistent kidneys.
Vadris   (Oct 18) [ 7690] Or maybe in lieu of that, just a tag that distinguishes whether a mob has 'parts' (like groin, kidneys, head) or not.
Alaudrien (Oct 18) [ 7690] on the madarchmage quest mebe make the salamander awake so ppl cant jus skip em and make em non aggro :p
Alaudrien (Oct 18) [ 7692] erm i meant the beast! sorry
Vadris   (Oct 19) [ 1971] For a rogue skill: Intercept Coin - an automatic skill that works when a rogue is hidden in a room.  When gold is passed from one person to another, or used at a shop, or split within a group, the rogue has a random % chance to intercept some of the gold on its way.
Alaudrien (Oct 22) [ 5082] mebe make karthay horses have infra?
Ulrich   (Oct 23) [ 7083] It should be suggested to newbies that they start as the good alignment.
Devon    (Oct 24) [10139] There should be town houses in the Knight's keep.
Devon    (Oct 24) [10063] As well as townhouses in the baracks, mainly to free up more spots and in charcterly that is where a lot of knights would live.
Tranos   (Oct 26) [ 5179] Put shirts and pants to buy in karthay's leatherworks store.
Arderion (Nov  1) [ 8130] For a spell (cleric likely, since they need the damned help... lousy level 6 slots and no spells) Summon Mount - conjures a spirit creature that's mountable.  Could be quite a handy thing, maybe.
TJaryon  (Nov 17) [ 9872] The End of the Pier rooms SHOULD be a good place to fish, Ive always had some luck there irl...ya know, on the water and whatnot.
Alviard  (Nov 21) [ 6002] Command - "stoke". When fires built by players start to die down, they can use the stoke command to "refresh" the fire, and keep it burning.
TJaryon  (Nov 22) [13080] characters would probably learn how to "build" a fire before they learn to "cook"
TJaryon  (Nov 22) [13088] gilean clerics, as scribes, should receive the skill "scribe" pretty early
TJaryon  (Nov 24) [ 8003] mounts automatically wander back to their original locations when they are no longer in use, leave your mount alone too long, he'll forget you and go home :)
TJaryon  (Nov 24) [ 7446] cant ride mounts indoors
Riva     (Nov 25) [ 5116] Haggle Skill - For those with high charisma, or some such.  Anyway, how it works is, when you 'haggle' in a shop, the shopkeeper gives you a special price.  'haggle #4' and the shopkeeper tells you, 'I'll let you have that for blahblahblah.'  And you buy it for a reduced price, depending on skill.  I dunno, just an idea.
TJaryon  (Nov 26) [ 7129] the "read" command should not apply to anything other than reading materials, so that when i try to "read" my books, it doesnt default the gilean pendant description (please thank you)
Sundassaysa (Nov 28) [ 9915] you should be able to hang a harp from your belt when it is not being held in someone's hand.
Vadris   (Nov 30) [ 9970] How about a 'patty cake' skill?
Rialana  (Nov 30) [ 5179] Since Sirrion clerics are alchemists, think it would be nice if they get the 'brew' option? I don't know what I'm doing as a sirr cleric lol
Grace    (Dec  7) [ 8016] Add a trigger to the nobleman in Karthay (who is riding on horseback) to deathload a mountable horse mob.
Korei    (Dec  9) [ 7212] You could make an enhanced hearing spell!
Korei    (Dec  9) [ 7212] able to hear whispers and if someone moves in the next area
Korei    (Dec 10) [ 3501] you couldmake a help command that has the color codes on it...
Korei    (Dec 13) [ 5291] try making the fish still cooked after rented with
Korei    (Dec 17) [10140] make more horses so each player can have two! XP
Serildi  (Dec 18) [ 6016] Maybe a type of display for the lanterns? Like *look lantern* *These copper-hooded lantern is a simple affair, weighted at the bottom to prevent it tipping over. It appears to have about four hours worth of fluid left.* USE IT
Artike   (Dec 25) [11271] stick to swords or somethign for a bit of time
Alviard  (Feb  7) [10063] Have the Herald only do the news when he is given a coin.
Rialana  (Feb 20) [ 1701] make the clerical spell flame blade last longer, for four ticks to memorize it, (average) that spell lasts for crap.
Sollas   (Feb 28) [ 5176] Dispel Magic should be able to actually dispel magic. Such as silence.
Sollas   (Mar  5) [ 4286] Control undead should go to superb instead of stopping at good.
Raeli    (Mar 21) [11272] There should be some more exotic weapons, like Kama and Kukri.
Vryce    (Apr 11) [ 5094] When you try something out in a store, perhaps have it give you it's long description so you can decide if your charcter would or would not use such an item.
Chislev  (Apr 12) [10176] I think the item 4907 the midnight blue cloak with silver designs should be !Sell, to keep players hording it to themselves.
Vryce    (Apr 12) [ 7320] Make it so the horses can see in the dark, otherwise you can't lead them even if you are holding a torch.
Elrithranduil (Apr 16) [ 3300] Areath'ar could be a trainer, and the chain he wears could go on one of the children.
Vryce    (Apr 24) [ 7411] Make it so humans can use a steel-bladed short sword with a polished wooden hilt, because it doesn't make sense that it is non human.
Vryce    (Apr 24) [ 7614] Make a bartender, or at least mobs in the Dirty Mug so it actually seems like a bar.
Nikcole  (Apr 25) [ 7195] if you eat enough chocolate cupcakes you should be affected like a haste potion *all that sugar*
Robert   (Jul  9) [10140] Increase the buffer used for emotes.
Darius   (Jul 14) [10073] enable the "read" command before being approved.  There is no other way to read posts on the policy board while waiting for an IMM
Varlo    (Dec 26) [ 2305] hay i had an idea what if you could rummage through a corpse and find things randomly on there body you know like a ramdom chance depending on the lvl of the mob .
Dromith  (Jan  3) [ 5095] Making it so you can tie up people that you subdue, also make it so you can lead a horse that someone else is mounted on.
Raymon   (Apr  6) [10138] Make it so it is at least possible to try and ride a mount at a low level skill of riding...  instead of just throwing you off every time when you try to mount it.
Branchala (Apr  6) [ 1020] Stop riding when your hp gets low.
Riryan   (Apr 12) [ 9811] autoassist  need I say more?
Avenavo  (May 19) [10140] Im sure you get this idea alot..But I suggest you (if not already working on) putting in a language system! It would be so cool...One can only learn two languages: Common, and his or her racial languages....a third language may only be learned with a good enough RP reason. Whats more, if you have gotten permission to use a third language, the skill would have to be unlocked by an immortal and would have to start at the 'awful' prac stage
Avenavo  (May 23) [ 3906] There should be a new hide command...where one could hide someone else
Lu-Cuir  (May 31) [ 2313] Should have our exp in numbers -AND- percent
Riryan   (Jun 28) [ 3508] Need to implement crafting skills; i.e. fletching, blacksmithing, tailoring, etc
Riryan   (Jun 30) [ 2316] need to implement an exp bonus for "quiet time"; i.e. 3 or less players on at any given time earn bonus exp
Akriam   (Jul 11) [11795] Do it right, Chem!
Akriam   (Jul 12) [11795] Step away from the sponge.
Helker   (Jul 13) [11271] i was thinkning that weapons like large axe's and warhammers and things like that could be 'Straped' to the back useing a harness think you all could get back to me in this ?
Riryan   (Sep  1) [10159] can we build a book that contains Kendrall's notes from the AoL forums? Seeing how I was the original author, feel free to add it.  It'll avoid crashing the mud when scribing.
Borusz   (Oct 22) [ 3553] Instead of charmed/controlled mobs crying when they attempt to leave, how about something a little less annoying and weird, like groaning or sighing or something?
Lillandra (Oct 23) [ 5293] Put a banker by the trading post.
Salagar  (Nov  4) [ 5059] A new line for mob creation which allows for a unique death.  For example one could write a line of text, any line to replace either the "A suchandsuch is dead!  R.I.P." or the "Your blood freezes as you hear a suchandsuch's death cry."  with something else.
Borusz   (Nov  9) [11133] Skill for knights: Train mount.  Works similar to control undead, except that it only affects mounts, allowing the knight to command the mount to fight and other such activities.
Avra     (Dec  3) [10140] In your 'score', a heading which gives you a general idea of your armor class, much like alignment.  So if your armor class is, say, 60-80 it says 'You're clothed, but not protected.' and if your armor class is, say, -20 to -40 it says 'Some castles aren't as well-protected as you are.'
Xaithia  (Dec 28) [ 2322] Lower EXP gain in groups of vastly differing alignments
Xaithia  (Jan  3) [10140] a command to cast prayers or spells at a whisper to be unheard, but at a greater chance to fail!
Aylu     (Jan  9) [ 9753] Three words, One hyphen: Giant Two-Handed Scythes.
Sebastian (Feb  4) [10064] need help files for the stuff in the news
Araen    (Feb  6) [10140] Tattoo shop!
Riryan   (Dec 18) [10992] knownas similar to intro except you can use this as a means of letting others know how everyone else addresses you or refers to you...without giving away your actual identity.

Candice  (Jan  5) [10112] When you are thirsty and hungry, and if you drink first you shouldn't suddenly get more hungry.
