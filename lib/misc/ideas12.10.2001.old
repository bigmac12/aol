Adriahna (Oct 15) [ 6248] Question: Can you force someone to force someone to force someone to do something?
Adriahna (Oct 15) [ 6248] There are no socials for relieving ones self.  imagine the mischief of relieving yourself upon someone.
Adriahna (Oct 15) [ 6248] maybe should be limited to imms to avoid player abuse.

Takhisis (Nov 10) [ 1111] pinch social
Vertrothe (Nov 11) [10063] Because of the lack of mages around, perhaps we immortals could start switching into the big mage mobs to train apprentices?

Adriahna (Nov 22) [ 6109] This is a weird one: but something that you can "trade in" your extra pracs for, like say, an extra stat point or something.  I dunno, just thinking is all.
Cassandra (Nov 22) [10172] and imms up there?

Tristan  (Dec  1) [10063] when a character says something, capitalize the first letter of their description
Lydani   (Dec  2) [ 2305] Just off the top of my head, thinking of the ICness of tells.  How about restricting them so only Paladins, Rangers, Druids, Clerics, Mages, etc ("magical" classes) have access to them?  reasoning is that they would have magical means of talking fro

Adriahna (Dec  7) [ 2308] Just a random thought:  Why not have rp factor have an affect on rent rates?  It might encourage people to rp to help solve their rent problems instead of h&sing to get money.
Adriahna (Dec  7) [ 2360] If disarm is so looked down upon in duels, perhaps it should be a thief and fighter skill instead of a knight/paladin/fighter skill.
Cassandra (Dec  9) [ 1711] Trying to kill me again?
Belthinus (Dec 11) [10063] Why is it that whenever someone is trying to get a quest done, everyone gets on their characters and tries to mess it up?

Andraya  (Jan 17) [ 5113] Could Takhisis give her cleric a tell to reply to?  That would be nice. :_
Achil    (Jan 17) [10138] Maybe this is already implemented, but it would be nice to be able to look in a direction and see the the title of the room(s) in that direction, so you can get an idea of where you're going.
Achil    (Jan 17) [10138] Addendum: The 'distance' (# rooms) one can see in a particular direction should be dependent on the light level and the sight ability of the looker....Heh, I'm used to being able to do this, so maybe I'm just being spoiled :)
Achil    (Jan 18) [10075] It would be nice to be able to target emotes at objects and people. Addition of arguments to express "his/her" "him/her" "<object>" and "<person>'s" would allow for more creative and less confusing emotes.
Achil    (Jan 18) [ 9809] It would be nice to have some sort of delay after using a move command, this would stop people from spamming moves, then resting, then spamming more moves, and would make movement a little more realistic (e.g. You could actually get a look at people
Achil    (Jan 18) [ 9809] The delay on moves could be adjusted with movement modifiers, so that you could 'walk' and have a normal delay after moving and use fewer movement points, or you could 'run' and use more movement points. I've only been here for 30 minutes and I've h
Achil    (Jan 18) [10063] The tell command should be modified so that you can use a person's keyword to target them with the command, instead of having to know their name.

Kiri-Jolith (Jul 19) [ 1220] Oh my God, they Killed Chemmy social.
Takhisis (Jul 19) [ 1111] Really could use that sob social right about now.
Shenn    (Jul 29) [ 6062] skinning, butchering etc... it would be nice if you could skin and butcher animals for for either food or as something to sell.
Siolenas (Jul 29) [ 8534] REO!
Maxwell  (Jul 30) [ 5277] the human slaves at the kobold camp should really be wearing chains, so when you kill them you can take them and wear them
Fenix    (Aug  2) [ 5082] Here's an interesting idea. A group of elves are travelling together, and run into a group of humans. An argument occurs, and the elves get mad. Wouldn't it be cool of they could change to elven language and talk like that, so that their words come 
Asireth  (Aug  4) [ 2247] I do not play a rouge, but I have an idea for the hide command, perhaps if a thief manages to hide and is sneaking they could walk around hidden as long as they kept managing to sneak.... Then in such places as the square just put a no sneak flag on
Talin    (Aug  5) [ 9801] Docks shouldn't be flooded in guards so murderers and theives can hang out safely in those areas...  Adds to the rp elements of Kalaman...
Saphrina (Aug  6) [ 5107] make a pose command so a player can make it so when someone sees them it has on the end is reading a book under a tree or is cleaning a sword 
Talin    (Aug  6) [ 3622] since the SUBDUE command is now in place, a drag command would be useful for dragging unconcious people, and maybe Knights should gain the bandage skill at higher lvls...
Sicsinet (Aug  6) [ 6006] I think all the guards are for rp reason but personly it spams me out and gets real annoying my idea just take a few of them out they are all ready every where
Maxwell  (Aug  9) [ 8103] gully dwarves should be a race option......
Maxwell  (Aug  9) [ 8024] and i was thinking deathknights should be a class option
Maxwell  (Aug  9) [ 8024] no. evil paladins isn't enough... i want to be undead
Sioleinas (Aug  9) [ 1891] This door can't be opened!
Terian   (Aug  9) [ 5278] Terian has the last but.  Always.
Darien   (Aug  9) [ 1003] I should be omnipotent
Darien   (Aug  9) [ 9816] Thieves weapons at low lvls are way too weak compared to say, Navy Commanders weapons
Darien   (Aug  9) [ 9816] if an enemy flees from you, you should have a chance of backstabing it again, but ofcourse not if you flee from them!
Serila   (Aug  9) [10103] help file for shillelagh
Darien   (Aug 10) [ 9815] Race should play factor in starting eq, I.E. Barbarians don't start with breeches but maybe skins instead?

Darien   (Aug 11) [ 8049] sneaking should let you pass people who are guarding
Darien   (Aug 14) [ 7005] movement should showup, (basic sketches) when typing group as well as hp
Darien   (Aug 14) [10140] have a Look Stars command which can be done outdoors to show which imms Constellations are showing, and then be able to PRAY to them ICly
Ciandra  (Aug 14) [10140] just a little idea i thought off while iw as notcing there are no horses on this game that maybe you could add them into the game but not everyone can get one, only the rich or those of high position and there uses in this world would not only be rp
Darien   (Aug 15) [ 8287] After the production of the stage in the dripping dagger it be cool to add some mob there who you can practice with, because it then makes the bar seem more real, with people entering and exiting more often, and more people too
Dalar    (Aug 16) [11702] let dwarves dual-wield axes ;)
Asireth  (Aug 17) [ 1988] give the kick skill one less round of lag, then at least you could use it as often as bash in a fight.
Reorx    (Aug 17) [ 1150] Another pwipe
Fenix    (Aug 19) [ 5107] Hey. Here's somthing. When your drunk, the MUD should scramble your speech. Like, taking "Hello sis" and making it "Heeezzzeelowwwyyyiii Ssssszzsssssiiiysssszzzss."
Branchala (Aug 19) [ 1020] straightjackets for the imms! and this is a serious idea..not one to take up the idea file! I know a few who should be wearing them...

Asireth  (Aug 23) [10063] have the salt crystalls hurt or kill the slugs in the mine...
Owen     (Aug 23) [10028] Bonzai?
Owen     (Aug 25) [ 9902] Go vis you ninny. :P
Asireth  (Aug 25) [ 7139] carry command, to be able to carry others... This would be great for chivalric knights.
Terian   (Aug 25) [ 5107] A command that allows you to delete your alias set.  ie) unalias or something like that.
Asireth  (Aug 25) [ 7267] wand of summon, then if your friend gets caught somewhere that is an anti-magic room with no exits you can summon him/her out without bothering an imm.
Kiri-Jolith (Aug 26) [ 1207] A place for paladins/monks/priests etc. to tithe money.
Foxsnout (Aug 27) [10172] it would be nice to be able to show your items to another player (example [show key to Cedion] and he will see the description of that item....)... bye /Foxsnout
Darien   (Aug 27) [10063] A resturant is needed, not just a bar!
Kiri-Jolith (Aug 28) [ 1060] Remove Tak's approve command.
Gina     (Aug 28) [10140] Since the new room has been added on to the tavern i have noticed that no one uses, one reason may be Gillian's staionary position, so my idea was for Gillian to walk between the rooms instead of staying in one room
Kiri-Jolith (Aug 28) [10063] Kill the damned ooc command.
Branchala (Aug 28) [ 1111] Kill Kiri then Kill me for using the idea command when I shouldnt' have
Darien   (Aug 29) [10140] SPOT skill, allows the detection of hidden theives, but causes lag, to prevent rapid use... Theives should get this at lower levels and others at higher
Darien   (Aug 29) [ 9823] alignment bonuses in groups, closer to the same adds combat bonuses, further adds penalties
Darien   (Aug 29) [10172] put a locked door, just for pick lock practice, in the theives guild
Darien   (Aug 29) [12000] Dvarish the drifter captain could sell a map of the oceans, which is just like the map of Ansalon sold basicly, but has about 3 or 4 landmarks on it, that when passed by sea would show up, so one could know how far along the trip they are
Darien   (Aug 31) [ 1941] for the gates that aren't used, have a locked gate with no key and unpickable blocking the exit and have the guards say, Citizens aren't allowed out here at this time, or something like that
Darien   (Aug 31) [ 9810] some way to see your backstab multiplyer
Gaven    (Sep  1) [ 9824] peek should be a skill you can get later, which increases the ammount seen when looking at someone
Darien   (Sep  2) [ 7127] when you can't see you should always subdue enemies, being unable to figure out where they are to kill them after they have stopped fighting back
Criton   (Sep  2) [ 5092] hmm hey i was wondering wouldnt it be a good ideal to put in a mage shop in karthay with some potions and assorted gear that mages would wear?
Kiri-Jolith (Sep  2) [ 1998] A room where we can transfer really bothersome newbies out of the newbie room (ones who spam, are abusive etc) that's made like a gallows, where they await their execution by an immortal.  I think that would be hot.
Antioch  (Sep  2) [ 9818] Armor Class Display on items and person would be cool
Antioch  (Sep  3) [ 7156] We should be able to hold light source items in the dark, the idea being, on e can still feel things out in the dark.
Gaven    (Sep  8) [ 3619] level 0 spells implemented as par new 3rd edition rules, such as minor blessing for priests that are skills, not spells, and maybe light for mages
Tarok    (Sep  8) [ 3612] Minotaurs shouldn't really allowed to be warriors, it should be either knights or priests, because of there complete honor
Tarok    (Sep  9) [ 3613] the skill at rescue should also determine the ammount of lag for the person being rescued, so someone horrible at rescue would maybe ammount to like 4-5 rounds of lag before the person rescued can respond, while someone with superb may give only 1-2
Tarok    (Sep  9) [ 2373] Certain mage spells of higher power should only be able to be learned by Practicing in a room with the mages mentor, and not a NPC mentor
Tarok    (Sep 10) [ 2379] compare instead of assess, tells which of the two items is better, if there the same type of item, ig Armor, necklace...
Tarok    (Sep 10) [ 2382] there should be a chance that you don't fall down while bashing, and a chance that you both fall down also!
Tarok    (Sep 11) [ 8340] gnomish travel between the gnome bird thingy and the gnomish workshop in  Kalaman after solving a puzzle, and obtaining an item from a powerful mob
Arauhalaur (Sep 12) [ 4801] fix the web so I can see aolapprovals
Vorak    (Sep 12) [ 5094] try to have imms on sometimes, i never see any when i am on and i have questions which since i dont know anyone and this place seems to be a very hard place to get to know people it is hard for me b/c i can't ask anyone my questions and i cant get a
