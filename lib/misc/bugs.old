Brock    (Nov  2) [ 1900] social 'raise' not sure what is is, but says 'That action is not supported.', hmm.. wonder if it's the one I made up.  'raises his hand, waiting patiently to be called on.'
Noctum   (Nov  4) [ 5113] Oh, before i forget.. you're able to type begin before your approved...  Pretty big, thing might need fixed *smiles*
Brock    (Nov  5) [ 9811] If this is not a bug, then It is very unfair...  City Guards 1) Remember 2) Track 3) Don't forget even after killing you a dozen times!  I have gone from almost 80% down to 0, because of one guard...
Erik     (Nov  6) [ 9819] Gilean's too busy.  Can't the guy have a day off?

Cassandra (Nov 22) [10063] Cassandra looks a little bored and in need of entertainment.
Brock    (Nov 25) [10064] You stun a city guard, then he shouts "There you are!  I knew I would find you!"...  Kinda funny though.
Brock    (Nov 25) [ 7368] 'deafening wind' you can hear normal conversation, but blocks out group tells...
Kheldar  (Nov 27) [ 6960] there's an evil mage mob in this room, but the room is an anti-magic room. His spells don't work when casting.

Vertrothe (Dec 15) [ 8283] Detect alignment doesn't show up on spells being memorized, it seems to be castable any number of times, and to memorize it does not consume mem slots.  Is this a new thing for paladins?
Vertrothe (Dec 15) [ 8290] Sorry to bother, since this is more of a building thing, but there are some unfinished rooms along the Talonis Highway.
Ada      (Dec 15) [10115] For the coder, but it's a typo: "Somebody tries a small, hard-leather shield, it seems to suit her well."  The second comma should be a semicolon.
Vertrothe (Dec 15) [ 7239] Damn, unholy avenger doesn't seem to be wieldable...
Amra     (Dec 15) [ 8289] standing in a Void.
Amra     (Dec 15) [ 8289] is not a bug.
Lunitari (Dec 15) [ 1001] Internet mudders are just way too stupid for the most part to be trusted with character creation.
Amra     (Dec 15) [ 7441] Note: I somehow think the selling of "pickled pigs feet" in a city populated by ungulates would be construed as somewhat distasteful.
Ninitkah (Dec 18) [10353] I don't know if this is a bug or not but it sure sucks .. .that druids can not mem two spells at the same time if they are the same level for instance I mem everything at the same time and the time it takes will be like 2h 3h 4h 5h 6h and so on..
Takhisis (Dec 18) [ 1006] Have more than 7 int, Ninit

Lydani   (Dec 19) [10161] It seems that mages can use the bronze leg guards.  This is a little screwy. :)
Ada      (Dec 20) [ 7028] The MEMORY mobflag should probably not make the mob explain 'Hey!  You're the fiend that attacked me!!!' as not all of the MEMORY mobs are capable of speech.
Erik     (Dec 22) [ 7106] Crybaby.
Creston  (Dec 22) [ 7423] the priest of sargonnas in the minotuar village can cast spells while silenced with the fourth level silence spell from a cleric of Zivilyn

Thollerhund (Jan  9) [ 9912] Your help should specify that multiple-word spell names must be cast AND memorized using a hyphen rather than spaces in the spell name.
Chemosh  (Jan  9) [ 1006] Thollerhund
Nuitari  (Jan  9) [ 1006] pfft, he has a point
Chemosh  (Jan  9) [ 1006] Nuitari, someone give me a can of raid.
Nuitari  (Jan  9) [ 1006] I do the bug killing around here, thanks.
Lunitari (Jan  9) [ 1006] Men are clueless, we need to rewire them so the brain in their head functions 0=)
Chemosh  (Jan  9) [ 1006] then luni wouldn't be able to ask other questions about the heads not above our shoulders.
Nuitari  (Jan  9) [ 1006] Bug reports from bitter women are not taken at face value
Nuitari  (Jan  9) [ 1006] And be nice to luni, she's got a very nice head on her shoulders
Nuitari  (Jan  9) [ 1006] it just belongs to her cat
Creston  (Jan 11) [ 5101] Mire does not seem to work

Achil    (Jan 18) [10178] The description of the newbie waterskin appears to be missing a few words at the tail end.
Achil    (Jan 18) [10075] I'm getting disconnected every time I try to submit a really long idea. Is this a warning? :)
Achil    (Jan 18) [10031] The metal grate at the intersection of Crown Street and Huma Lane in Kalaman doesn't have the word 'grate' included in its list of keywords.

Kiri-jolith (Jan 29) [10063] Merit's spelling and grammar are faulty.  Is faulty, his grammar and spell is faulty.
Yensid   (Feb  1) [ 5003] ***ATTENTION GODS: OOC-- I was disconnected from the server at 2am on Fri. the 2nd. I reconnected as soon as I could, and then typed 'begin' because I started in the Newbie area, and then I started in Karthay.

Paedarith (Mar  8) [ 5272] Next to Takhisis' name in the "WHO", it has this <AFK> thing.  Is that a typo?
Talitha  (Mar  8) [ 7114] just a little typo...flame blade spell has a blade of flame comes into existance...should be existence
Alyssa   (Mar 11) [10063] Tonight a Minotaur was attacked and killed by a city guard 3 times. I'm sure the first time he attacked hunter/killer does not just go off. But once he was dead it should have stopped and did not.It was a Minotaur with red eyes and black hair. Might

Qualis   (Mar 31) [10131] the town guards in kalaman seem to come back in the same room after being killed, and do not leave. This causes about 12 of them to stay in the same room..

Mialee   (Apr 15) [ 2395] this isn't really a bug but i would like to call attention to it. When i disarm the chef he continues to slash me.. now this isn't realistic and not hard to fix, just enter medit and change the attack to hit or punch or something, when he is wielding
Takhisis (Apr 15) [ 1111] I'm so glad I have Mialee around to tell me what is or isn't hard to fix.

Qualis   (Apr 21) [ 7113] water breathing does not have a message.
Blake    (Apr 22) [ 7306] In my oppinion, you should not even be allowed to go to the intersecion that leads to either kendermore or istar if you cant defeat the kender.
Qualis   (Apr 24) [ 7475] Spell memorization seems really messed up lately.  Sometimes, even after a tick, my spells will not change the time needed to mem.  Additionally, right now all my spells are taking 13h to mem (when resting).
Taber    (Apr 25) [ 7306] this dang kender wont let me go to karthay
Blake    (Apr 26) [ 5098] When we tried to use a "vial of black liquid" (Poison that is sold in bandits hideout) on a "Mace of Destruction", it crashed the server.  We are sure of this because we tried it a seccond time to make sure that was the cause and the results proved t

Taber    (May  1) [ 7110] militia, how do they know if I am evil or not? are the magical militia? keep getting attacked for walking by them
Chemosh  (May  1) [10063] they are knights you moron.
Taber    (May  1) [ 1997] normal citizens can tell i am evil, that is a little far fetched, they wouldnt just attack someone walking down the streets, citizens dont have nuts that big

Qualis   (May 15) [ 6186] the colon after 'Name' is cyan, but should be white - to match the others.
Qualis   (May 16) [ 6141] I'm not actually sure if vampiric touch gives the caster any hp at all.  In 15 castings, I havn't received any. 
Cardorith (May 17) [ 5081] And, to add insult to injury, someone cast darkness in Karthay square.  Frick sakes.
Saul     (May 23) [10063] cone of cold does not tell you wether or not it accually slowed the target down.
Saul     (May 23) [10063] fireball does far less damage compared to spells like lightning bolt... wich you get 4 levels before fireball.
Rowan    (May 23) [ 9960] Not so much a bug really, but same difference I suppose: the tree branch from the Ellinead Forest appears to not be made of wood, for the purposes of the shillelagh spell. Thanks, sorry to bother.

Alyssa   (Jun 12) [10063] Why is it that Sadriel can enter Kalaman square cast an attacking spell on two people and then Log out without waiting the 15 minute flag? Its wrong VERY wrong.
Rowan    (Jun 15) [ 7759] It appears at times, if you are in a form with a summoned creature and grouped. When the grouped creature dies, and the battle finishes your xp gain will be less than usual if you have not ungrouped, despite the fact you are the only extant member of

Papyllon (Jun 20) [11832] Dunward sells the Briolette but does not buy it back? Is that right?
Rowan    (Jun 23) [ 3974] You can not group summoned creatures who are hidden, for instance the large green snake of animal summoning II. While you receive the normal grouping messages you will not show as being grouped, nor will xp gain be reflected by it.
Rowan    (Jun 23) [ 3974] This persists even after you order the creature visible.
Rowan    (Jun 24) [ 2218] Druids, or at least myself at any rate, seem to be unable to practice the detect-poison skill.
Rowan    (Jun 27) [10063] Either I am doing something wrong, or the skills may be disabled, but I am unable to prac either detect or remove posion.
