This is a few hours early, but please forgive me for this.

Septempber 11, 2001 is a day in which we will all remember the grevious
scars lashed upon the back of our nation by the whip of terrorism.  Many
things have occured since then that have brought our nation closer, some
of them good, but some of them bad.  We have come through this horrible
experience forever changed, and no longer are we the "child like" nation.
We have had to grow up, and the growing was done extremely fast.  I am
proud to say, however, that America's heart is still the same in all areas
that matter.  When others need help, we still reach out a helping hand
without looking first to see if another country is going to bite that
hand.  We do not walk in fear, but with our heads held high still, and not
afraid to say that we are, in deed, human by birth, American by the grace
of God.  I remember watching that day as the second plane hit the second
trade center, and I remember going to work that night next to Dulles
Airport in Virginia, and hearing no airplanes, on or off the airport
grounds.  I remember sitting in my yard for the next few weeks and seeing
no planes fly across the sky, yet I was in between two major airports.
My greatest fear, as I sat at work during those midnight shifts, was not
that the planes would not start flying, but that they would, and we would
see the same horror revisited on us again.  I remember taking a drive
by the Pentagon and seeing that mighty bastion damaged and hurt,
bleeding smoke as if it were the blood of those that died in it's
powerful walls serving our country.  But something happened.  During that
fateful day, a handful of Americans stood up on a fourth plane, and said
"No!"  Through them, American pride, strength, courage, and honor came out
strong, much like it did in our forefathers when they said "No!" to
England.  Much like it did in those same founding forefathers who had the
courage and strength to stand up to the armies of the most powerful nation
in it's time and fight for what they believed in.  Through this something
incredible happened.  After the racial violence died down, and after the
initial fear, Americans stood up and continued on.  Through those handful
of Americans who fought their captors, the pride, strength, courage, and
honor of Americans came racing back to the front, like it did in our
fathers and grandfathers.  I am a child of the 80's.  I remember the cold
war, and my biggest fear was a nuclear holocaust.  I remember either you
were an American, an ally, or you were a communist, or "commie".  You were
either for us, or against us, and I remember President Reagen pulling this
patriotism from deep inside of us.  I am glad to be an American, no, I am
proud and honored to be one.  It is the greatest thing I can imagine, and
I could not even comprehend being anything but part of this wonderful, and
great nation.  I hope each of you share my pride, and remember this in the
future.  Many of you are young that play this game, but many of you
remember what I am talking about.  Do not EVER forget that while we may be
brash, arrogant, and pushy as a country and as Americans in general, we
are always there to help others, and we are always there to help each
other as well.  We are a family, and while we might fight and hurt one
another in this country, nobody, and I mean NOBODY will every come in here
and harm one of us and get away with it.  Stand tall, my friends and
fellow Americans, be proud.  After all, we ARE Americans.

Normally I sign off as "The Staff" but I have spoken this on my own.  I
will gladly put the other immortal's names on here, but I would not deem
to speak for them on this matter.
