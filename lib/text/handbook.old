This is the immortal handbook.

If you have any questions about your duties, please refer here.

	1.) Your immortal and your mortal characters should not be on at
        the same time without permission from an implementor, or for use
	in a quest.

	2.) You should also not have more than one mortal logged in at a
	time.  You can have as many characters in the database as you
	wish, but no more than one logged in at once.

	3.) Any immortal equipment you make should have no stats on it.
	If you have stats on it, it will be deleted.  Furthermore, it
	should be created in zone 12.

	4.) Pkilling immortal to immortal is illegal and will not be
	tolerated.  Killing morts is different IF IT'S DONE IN A ROLE
	PLAYING SENSE!  If an imm kills a mort an investigation will be
	done to determine why it was done and if it was correct.

	5.) Imms should not be pthieving from each other or from mortals.
	There's no need for you to take something you can just load.

	6.) Helping people with your mortal is fine, but do not powerlevel
	them and try not to let other mortals know you are an imm.
	Furthermore, in either imm or mort form, you do not give them
	information or stats on mobs, eq, or directions to places they can
	not find themselves.  If a mort dies and we are preparing to
	reboot, then please grab their corpse, get the equipment, and hold
	it in your inventory till the mud comes back up (be sure to save
	before quiting).

	7.) Also, please keep your interaction with morts to a minimum in
	your immortal form.  If/when you do interact with morts in your
	imm form, then you should execute this in RP fashion (unless you
	are doing something such as reimbursement of equipment or such).

        8.) All zones made on this mud are for the property of this mud
        and this mud only.  We will not give them out and they will not
        leave this server.
