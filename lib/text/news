                      NEW SPELL-CASTING LANGUAGE!

Majere was able to get the existing code compiled without much effort.
As a result we will be fixing bugs and adding small content from
time-to-time, as the administration allows.

Implemented here and now is an adjustment to the existing method of
encrypting spells.  The dragonlance list of spell-words posted by
Kassilis was implemented by Majere.  The post can be found here:

http://www.ageoflegends.com/phpBB2/index.php/topic,190.0.html

The new system uses dragonlance words for spells where there is
a match, and the current system of alphabetic encryption elsewhere.
For example the word 'light' translates to 'shirak'.  However the
word 'bubble' has no translation and simply uses the regular
letter-to-letter encryption and so would simply come out as
garbled text.

A second change to this system removes all other spell casting classes
from the whole encryption process.  Thus only mages will have their
spells encrypted.  Other classes, clerics for example, speak their
spells in the form of prayers, and so would be understandable by any
who can speak their language.  As a result when they cast a spell it
is shown in plain text to all (at least until languages are implemented).

        NEW EXPERIENCE TO NEXT LEVEL DISPLAY IN SCORE!


Majere has implemented a new system to display experience.  Please do not
be alarmed if your Exp To Next Level % in your score is different.  This
% value is now the actual % of experience that you have achieved to rise
to the next level.  Previously this % value was a comparison of the total
experience you had from all your levels compared to the total you needed
for the upcoming level.  The new value is the actual percent of what you
have against how much you need.  Here's an example:

Old System:
A) Total Exp:                    7,500
B) Exp Required for Nexr Level: 10,000
C) Percent Value to Next Level:    75%

New System:
A) Total Exp:                           7,500
B) Exp Required for Last Level:         5,000
C) Exp Required for Next Level:        10,000
D) Actual Exp Required for Next Level:  5,000 ( (C) 10,000 - (B) 5,000 = (D) 5,000)
E) Actual Exp Achieved for Next Level:  2,500 ( (A) 7,500 - (B) 5,000 = (E) 2,500)
F) Actual Percent Value to Next Level:    50% ( (E) 2,500 / (D) 5,000 = (F) 50%)

                    NEW ROLE-PLAYING TOOLS!

Majere has added some nice new things to help the whole role playing process happen
with a little less technical effort.

First of all, in response to requests by players, the maximum long description
length has been increased dramatically.  The maximum length is now 2,000 characters,
which is approximately 20 lines at 80 characters each.  This should be more than
enough for even the most desc-happy of players.

Secondly the sayto command has been implemented, allowing characters to target
specific individuals (even themselves) in the room with their verbal communication,
be it in or out of character.

Thirdly, we have added the ability to put emotes in your say and sayto strings.  To enable
this, all you have to do is enclose the emoted text within two asterixes ('*').  The stated
syntax for this feature says that the enclosed emote string must be before the say string,
but in truth, it can be anywhere in the string (though after the sayto target in the case
of the sayto command).  In the case that there is more than one string enclosed in asterixes
only the first will be considered an emote.  If no closing asterix is added to the emote string
then the entire string will be considered an emote, and thus there will be no say string,
resulting in a syntax error, and the command will not go through.


Syntax:

say <*emote*> <say text>

Example: 

Input: 'say *Looking around the room curiously* Hmm, anyone here?'
Output: 'Looking around the room curiously, you say, 'Hmm, anyone here?'.'

sayto <*emote*> <say text>

Example:

Input: 'sayto dibbles *Staring him straight in the eyes* who do you think you are?'
Output: 'Staring him straight in the eyes, you say to Dibbles, 'Who do you think you are?'.'

The <*emote*> is entirely optional.  Omitting it will simply make the string appear as it
does currently.

Examples:

Input: 'say Hmm, anyone here?'
Output: 'You say, 'Hmm, anyone here?'.'

Input: 'sayto dibbles Who do you think you are?'
Output: You say to Dibbles, 'Who do you think you are?'.'

Finally on an unrelated, but entirely positive note, players will no longer suffer the
frusteration of watching a mob die of bloodlack and thus loosing all their hard-fought-for
exp from that fight.  The mob will remain incapacitated, mortally wounded, or
what-have-you, and will not lose any hp whatsoever, unless it is from a direct hit from
a player character or other mob.  Tick-damage rooms are the exception to this rule.  Mobs
can still die in a tick-damage room, thus 'stealing' the exp from players.

Any and all questions ort comments about the say or sayto command, the extra long 
description length, or the bloodlack mob death fix can be posted at the following thread:

                         COMING SOON!

We will be adjusting the spells for certain clerics and paladins (for
example: Paladins of Kiri-Jolith will not be stuck with silly spells
that do them little to no good).

Adding a new zone in soon that will help you from level 5-10, as well
as offer monks a bit more equipment and possibly weapons.
