WE HAVE A NEW WEBSITE LOOK!!  Check it out at www.ageoflegends.com.  We
also have the forums integrated through the portal!

There is now new information for knights of Ansalon (Knights of Solamnia,
Takhisis, and the Legion of Steel) posted on the forums.

ATTN KNIGHTS AND WANNA BE KNIGHTS!!  There is important information
for you on the forums regarding your pay and a new way we will be
rewarding you for doing your job.  It is a far better deal than the
pay we were giving you monthly before, and I hope you will all be happy
with this new way of doing things!!

We now have forums up and operating!  You can view the link for it on
our webpage of www.ageoflegends.com  The link is on the left.
