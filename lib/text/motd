&WWelcome to Age of Legends!&n

A newly arrived band of merchants have taken to the major 
highways all around Krynn!

Each new merchant marks their location with bright pink 
sign in the middle of the highway, adjacent to their wagon's 
location. Be sure to stop in and see what they have to sell 
before they pack up and move to their next location.

FYI: Palanthas is currently closed while it is undergoing major 
reconstruction, so please pardon the dust and massive boulders.

Thank you!
