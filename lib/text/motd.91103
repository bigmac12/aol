Today marks the two year anniversary of a hideous and horrible attack on
the United States.  The scars, while healing, still hurt as bad to us as
the day they first occured.  Those lost are still mourned, missing closure
as they were buried under tons of rubble, or lost in a plane crash.  Last
year I wrote on this subject, only I concentrated on how great America
became.  This time I am going to concentrate on that fourth plane.  We
play, on this mud, Heros.  A hero is someone who does something to save
others, or another, regardless of the danger that my occur to themself.
The greatest monument to fallen heros is not a marble statue, or massive
grave site, but a silent area filled with nothing.  As Robert Redford said
in The Last Castle, "The greatest monument to fallen men are on the
battlefields, in a jungle or forest, with a rifle sticking out of the
ground, and a set of dog tags."  Those on that fourth plane are true
heros, on the level of our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines.  There is
no greater sacrifice a person can make for their country, than to die for
it.  I hope that the wives, childern, and family of those heros find peace
in God, and in the solemn pride of so costly a sacrifice that was laid
upon the alter of freedom by their loved ones.  "Let's Roll" United Flight
93. A handful of ordinary citizens, in a brief moment, became a handful of
extraordinary heros.
