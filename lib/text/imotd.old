New motd up for the morts.  May want to read it (type motd at any prompt
as an imm or mort).

Race help files are in.  Type help (racename) to see the help on it.  If
there is a race I missed (that is available to the players), email the imm
list to let me know :)  Thanks

I have made a change to the policy.  No more verbal warnings.  I am tired
of the deviations from policy.  If a player asks where the policy board is
for the town they are in, please feel free to make an exception to give
them directions to that board and that board only.  For more info on this
sudden change (that I have consulted only Hidd and Krystal on) please read
the main immortal board.
