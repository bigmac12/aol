&RATTENTION ALL PLAYERS!!  We are currently offering an amnesty of sorts
to all former players and imms who have been banned, or just left.  We
are heading into our 10th year on march of 06, and I'd like it to be a
great beginning for us.  Let's invite back all players and imms that we
can contact.  Many players hold this mud special, as it was their first
mud, or their first RP mud.  Let's let them see how much we've grown!!&n

&GATTN ALL KNIGHTS!  Please send an email to chemosh@ageoflegends.com 
with your forum username, and rank so he can add you into the correct
knightly forum on the forums.  Thanks!&n
