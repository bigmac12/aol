We are trying to decide what direction to go in with the development
of Age of Legends and have decided to either continue with our plans
to launch Age of Legends d20 code in the coming weeks, or to continue
with the current Age of Legends code, and upgrade it to the latest
version of TBAMUD with CWG Suntzu enhancements.

TBAMUD is what Circlemud has become.  Last year Jeremy Elson, creator
of Circlemud disbanded the project.  Rumble and the folks at the builders 
academy and Circle With Goodies owner zizazat collaborated on
TBAMUD which is what Circlemud is called now.  CWG Suntzu is a
distribution of TBAMUD with a bunch of extra stuff patched into it.

If we went with the d20 code, the world would stay the same, though
the stats on some equipment would change if the current stats weren't
compatible with the new system.  Zone levels would remain the same
and the new max level would be 60.  All characters would have their
levels and equipment reimbursed.  Further development would follow
the d20 rules whenever possible.  In this case the old code would
remain open but no further development would be done on it.

If we upgrade to the latest version of TBAMUD no further development
will be done on the existing code, and we would work on transferring
the features of the current code into a TBAMUD stock mud.  This would
take a few months.  Once we open the TBAMUD version of the mud it will
probably be missing some of the less necessary features at first and
you will need to be patient as we get them back in, after which we
can work on improving the existing mud with new classes, features,
and zones.  Those interested in a d20 mud solution would be able to
play Age of Mortals MUD which is the same d20 code owned by Majere
except in a Post War of the Souls timeframe and world.

The final option is to do both... to have a d20 and TBAMUD version
of Age of Legends.  The drawback to that is slightly longer development
times on new features, though not that much longer since Majere would
be working on his own d20 mud regardless of what is decided here
and the coding changes can be shared with Age of Legends.

We ask players to please vote on this matter on our website.  There is
a poll in the left side nav bar.  Please vote once and only once.

Thanks everyone for your patronage and patience with us on this matter.
