Help MysticAdventures:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mystics are on a continual journey of self-discovery, their focus internal 
rather than external.  They may undertake dangerous quests to test themselves
and add to their knowledge of the spiritual forces of the world.  Adventure 
sometimes finds mystics who do not seek it, for their powers (which do not 
require obedience or homage to any deity) make them useful to others.
