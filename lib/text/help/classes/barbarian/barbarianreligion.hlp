-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barbarian worship is usually casual, though tribal clerics and druids command
respect.  Barbarians revere the deities of nature:  Habbakuk, Chislev, or
Zeboim, depending on their alignment.  Some barbarians distrust established
religion entirely, and prefer an intuitive, natural relationship to the 
cosmos over formal worship.  A barbarian is capable of fierce deviotion to 
his god.
