Help BarbarianTraits:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The barbarian is an excellent fighter.  Where the fighter's skill in combat
comes from training and discipline however, the barbarian has a powerful
rage.  While in this berzerer fury, he becomes stronger and tougher, better
able to defeat his foes and withdtand their attacks.  These rages leave him
winded, and he only has the energy for a few such spectacular displays per
day, but those few rages are usually sufficient.  He is at home in the wilds,
and runs at great speed.
