CON

This allows you to get a GENERAL feel for how close of a match it will
be between you and a mob.  It is NOT exact, as it takes into account
ONLY base levels, not spells, skills, armor you might have or the mob
might have, or weapons, etc., but it gives you enough of an idea for you
to decide if you can survive a fight with the mob.
#
HUNGER

You CAN die from being overly hungry, do not ignore the message, it is
not just for fun or cosmetics.  So pay attention to your hit points,
and the level of hunger you are at.

NEWBIELINE

Help Newbieline:
------------------------------------------------------------------
     The newbieline is a method of communication open to newbies 
In particular, but also to anyone on the mud.  It is designed with
The purpose of helping newcomers to the game learn about the world,
to ask questions, and to get help from people when they need it.
It is *NOT* a chat line, so please do not use it as such.  We are 
a roleplaying mud, so seeing out of character chatter is very 
distracting and we ask it be kept to a minimum.  Examples of good
uses for the newbie line are to welcome a new player, to ask some
basic directions to locations, to ask how the mud commands work 
(how do I wield my sword, how do I get something from my backpack,
etc.)  Asking for help leveling, or if people want to party, or 
which item is better than another item, are all illegal questions.
To toggle the newbieline, type newbieoff (off) or newbieon (on).

NEWBIE

This is the helpfile for those of you that are new to our mud.  It encases
some helpful files for those of you that are new.  To view the policies of
the mud, please go to the nearest inn and read the boards there.  The
boards play an integral part of this mud, and should be read each time you
log in.  If you TRUELY need help, then please ask, but only after you have
read the help files, and boards for the answer first.  Spells can be found
by typing help spell (spellname).  Areas covered in this help file are
Hunger, Thirst, RP, and Con.
#
RP

Role Playing is required here.  If you cannot role play, then this is not
the mud for you, as we do levy punishment on those who do not role play,
and reward those who do.  Also, deleteing and recreating a character is
essently a death for that character, and that character from that point on
is a new character, and does NOT know anyone it did before. 
#
THIRST

You CAN die from being overly hungry, do not ignore the message, it is
not just for fun or cosmetics.  So pay attention to your hit points,
and the level of hunger you are at.
