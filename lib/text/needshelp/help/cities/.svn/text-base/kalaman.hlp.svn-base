Help Kalaman:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Kalaman is one of the more popular cities of Ansalon.  It is not a
terribly large place, nor does it share the speldors of Palanthas or
Istar, but it is a good and comfortable town which many adventurers
frequent.  The town holds a temple devoted to the Gods of Light, a
large bathhouse, and a garrison for the Knights of Solamnia.  The 
local shops include a jeweler's, magic store, clothiers, tailors,
blacksmiths, leatherworkers, and provisions stores, most of which
are located around Merchant's Square to the north of the city.  There
are two taverns in Kalaman worthy of note, the Bloody Fist in the 
port district, and the Dripping Dagger Taproom off the main inn.
Stanley, the proprietor of the Dripping Dagger Inn, runs a top-notch
Establishment and is always happy to welcome anyone to his home town.
