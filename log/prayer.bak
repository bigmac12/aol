Some more devotees should be falling in line soon, but I am still not sure what to do with Dagoth,the Barbarian Ranger. Perhaps he can be of use to you, yet he is one with the forest. Nevertheless, as long as he does not discourage your will nor harm the church or any follower of it, he may live.

Jul 17 21:45:03 :: Darvin (prayer): Lord sargonnas, karthay has become quite as the patrons wait patiently for actions against Kalamans laws. The citizens are outraged, and Christov seeks action. He seeks to lead the followers of evil against the knights, and demands forceful action. He will surely loose, a fool to think the knights are stupid enough. As unhonorable as most are they are not dimwitted. Christov is a powerful ally, with a foolish brain. What does you will command? Shall I support his foolishness, or keep quiet?

Jul 21 13:31:13 :: Darvin (prayer): Dark lord, we are yours to command, Christov is obviously getting himself into way more than what he can handle. I have ordered for any follower to let him do so and have tried myself to talk him out of it. He is thick headed and will not listen. If he disgraces you he will be dealt with in a inhumane way. If he succeeds he will fall to the backstabing of the followers of Takhisis. He has the power and strength we need, but he plans to abuse and loose it.

Bout all I could do was bandage that fella who was near death, couldnt help him further with his injuries. I don't know what to do about it, Reorx. I'm a Defender, we defend. It's what we do. Still wish I had some hea
Aug  4 09:52:01 :: Dari (prayer): Reorx, made my way through Morgion's temple where I knew they had a shop that carried healer stuff.

Help wherever and however I can. Amen.
Aug  4 11:12:17 :: Dari (prayer): Reorx, I know two of the folks that been out murdering at least one person. I'm a bit shocked by it.

Jan  6 21:18:41 :: Velk-Yxti (prayer): That is what I must speak about. Ah, I am ever so greatful for the lands that you created here for us, with the aid of your brother and father. Honour, is something that deserves very much respect, and the same goes to justice, and the laws here.
Jan  6 21:19:28 :: Velk-Yxti (prayer): I am forever in your service, I will ensure the laws are serviced here as they should be, even if death has something to say about it. An honourable battle to you, father Corij. I must seek Faith, she is waiting. Praise you once again for your gifts.

I am attempting to make a army in your name. I wish to lead this army into any battle you want. I just need to find worthy people to wear your symbol. I have found a few, But you are the person that has the last say.
Jan  7 21:45:17 :: Kayge (prayer): I long to serve you, but you do not answer.  I seek to bring choas to the world from your name. You bring me a path to follow, I had none before so my meaning in my dismal life has arrived. Answer me and I will give my life for you, and take away an unlimited amount of others. I have been blind since childhood, but I will seek light through your darkness.
Jan  7 21:49:32 :: Kayge (prayer): My Dark Queen, let me serve you. I will bring you high amung all others. They will fear, and shutter when they see the face that represents you. Furthermore they will cringe as my dagger strikes the life from their bodies. I soak my tatoo with blood from your fountain. The evil purity that develops once again casts a true strenght and guidance to my dagger. I will not fail. Dragon Queen, I beg of you.. let me join your Evil Masquerade, you will not be dissapointed.

My spirit, my life, my soul, it is yours, to use and channel through, to imbue havoc and chaos, to lie and to trick, to harm and to fraud. I have done well in causing chaos in a Solamnic city - a random man is deemed dishonourable and lost a great deal of respect to his name, because of my lies.

Jan 27 15:27:45 :: Olivia (prayer): Because of my lies, he is frowned upon, because of my lies, he has become hated, knights have become cautious, men have almost began fighting him, all because of me. Best of it all, I love it. Men grovel at my feet, wishing for me to adore them.
Jan 27 15:27:58 :: Olivia (prayer): I flirt and I torment, I tease and I smile, I play and I minpulate, I take and I gain, at my delight, at their expense, and I am not even in the least touched by it.

Since your demand, I've kept tally, and I plan to increase it as often I can. So far, there are three who have been destroyed.
Jan 28 15:07:02 :: Olivia (prayer): One man is dead, another man is heart broken, and the last has lost his respect both as a man, but his honour, his coins, and his heart has been scarred.

Jan 28 15:07:34 :: Seiki (prayer): Hiddukel Mighty M'Fistos, i come before you today Mighty one. For one to priase the work of one of your servents, Olivia is caseing much choas within the cityu of kalaman, and chrushing many.

Thou knowest, father, that as yo

Jan 29 11:13:06 :: Velk-Yxti (prayer): I will defend the citizens honourably in your name. In your name they will recognize defeat, in your name, they will see the purpose of Light. Darkness will fall. I'd be shamed to displease the Great Bison, don't expect me to let the evils prevail.
Jan 29 16:05:52 :: Kariton (prayer): Lightbringer I ask you to turn about the man named Velk-Yxti, he is going foolishly to his death to try and stop a follower of the Black Wind.

I pray, Father, for Lilliath, for Jocelyn, and for Zyren; three of my friends who have yet to take the Test of High Sorcery to become part of the Conclave.

Jun 18 21:08:35 :: Anoreth (prayer): Great Bah'Mut, praise be your light and glory, strong be the creations and ideals of your faithful.  Proud and grateful am I, your servant, to find myself in the hallowed halls of your grace in this city, so far from the one of which I was raised.

Jun 21 05:30:24 :: Russel (prayer): Blessed Father of Justice and saviour of the Light, thank you reigning upon me another glorious day to rebuild my swordsmanship and establish courage once again to bring fallen righteousness back to abolish the darkness of Tyrant evil.
Jun 21 05:30:54 :: Jenica (prayer): Kiri-Jolith, Russel is a moocher. Also, he has a hook-hand. Please don't give him anything, thanks.
Jun 21 05:31:45 :: Russel (prayer): Each day I will train and practice to make sure that evil is destroyed, but next time I will work with Unity, and place a great trust in my brethren of the Knighthood. This is my goal; to rebuild myself. To allow myself to serve Solamnia once again and keep its inhabitants protected.
Jun 21 11:54:47 :: Cedrif (prayer): Sword of Justice, Please watch over me during this hard time. I just got word that My wife has passed on.

Jun 21 12:26:50 :: Kendrall (prayer): E'li, I pray hear your servant.  Look upon your knight, Sir Verramos, and have compassion upon him.  You alone know the pain and grief he is going through, over the loss of his beloved wife.  I pray, Father, grant him the strength he needs, and help him to continue on in your service.  Comfort him, Father.  I pray this in thy holy name.
Jun 21 19:55:49 :: Theobald (prayer): Blessed be He, the Great Father, Draco Paladin that offers forth His Wisdom and Compassion unto us his children, that we may better understand Justice.  Grateful are we, His children and followers, that we receive these blessings and strive to make these lands a better place and blessed we are again for such head pattings as make us feel warm and fuzzy in His name.
Jun 21 20:41:29 :: Jenica (prayer): Kiri-Jolith, I continue to learn of your ways in the hope that I may become a tool in the fight against the evil of this world. Every day evil makes the innocent suffer, and I would stand and fight against such evil. I offer you myself, my loyalty, and my prayers such as they may be. Praise be to you, Sword of Justice.
Jun 21 20:46:02 :: Jenica (prayer): Praise be to the Sword of Justice! Let evil be vanquished wherever it is encountered.
Jun 21 20:48:10 :: Russel (prayer): Some time ago, I asked myself... 'What is glory? What is honour, and obediance. Justice and righteous warfare?' I had only ideas, and not much of an answer...
Jun 21 20:48:27 :: Russel (prayer): But now that I've faced evil first hand, now that I know what it is like to witness their truth in tyrannous, disgraceful methods of action... I am beginning to understand.
Jun 21 20:48:45 :: Russel (prayer): I know how heavily honour plays on a man's worth. A man is nothing without his honour, father Justice, and I apologize for taking so long to understand this...
Jun 21 20:49:06 :: Russel (prayer): I understand that without obediance, I am nothing. Without my friends and comrades within the Brotherhood, there is no way I can stand above evil. It is with unition that light will shine and dissipate the darkness around us.
Jun 21 20:49:37 :: Russel (prayer): While I was being tortured by the Blasphemy, I began to miss what I had took for granted... I began to miss what a reward righteousness truely is.
Jun 21 20:50:04 :: Russel (prayer): It's with my new found understanding, Father Justice, that I WILL find means of bringing light to Krynn. Where darkness prevails, it shall otherwise face defeat! Where the Light shines, righteousness will be follow!
Jun 21 20:50:42 :: Russel (prayer): Holy righteousness, that is what we need... And that is what will be had. This is my promise, this is my Oath.
Jun 21 20:55:23 :: Russel (prayer): That warmth, father Justice. It is that warmth that I want everyone to feel. To become a part of.
Jun 21 21:03:36 :: Jenica (prayer): P.S., Russel has a hook hand. It's creepy. Praise Kiri-Jolith.
Jun 22 12:54:30 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Please watch over me in my time of need. I feel as thou my heart has been torn from me. My wife a follower of your wife has passed on. I will always remember her. Please guide me in my time of need.
Jun 22 12:59:04 :: Russel (prayer): May the blessed child of Maurynna live life peacefully in the motherly hands of the Skymistress... May she be cared for, and may she live prosporously. May she be with Cedrif always, both in heart, and soul.
Jun 22 12:59:58 :: Russel (prayer): Let the Sword of Justice guard over this pact of love, may He show courage and honour in the line of righteousness.
Jun 22 18:31:12 :: Kendrall (prayer): (in Qualinesti) E'li, I pray hear me this evening.  I pray, Father, for all the Knights; keep them safe and bless them.  Grant Cedrif your peace and wisdom in the face of losing his beloved wife.  I pray for my friends whom you have blessed me with; keep them safe as well.  As for Jocelyn, Father...I ask of you to impart your wisdom and knowledge to her, that she would be moved in her heart and spirit to focus on becoming a follower of your son, Solin.  Let all be done according to your will, and i
Jun 22 18:34:51 :: Anoreth (prayer): Smite everyone in this room, O'lord.  For they have been deemed naughty in mine eyes, and shall snuff it.  Well, everyone except for me, and well, maybe Jocelyn, too.  Amen.
Jun 22 19:30:35 :: Anoreth (prayer): Praise be the Glory and Wisdom of Great Bah'Mut, Father of Good and Justice.  Praised are we, his children, that walk in His light and grace.  Blessed be the Compassion that He teaches, blessed the heart that tempers the hand.
Jun 22 19:34:51 :: Anoreth (prayer): Great Bah'Mut, Father of Light, it is this Compassion that I now seek. Not now for myself, most hallowed Lord among Lords, but for the lady Jocelyn Auraven.  Much danger I fear for her, many paths that she may tread.  A would be magus is she, and I see in her the great potential path of your honored Son, m'lord.  Please keep her in your light, Father, and guide her choices with your Wisdom.  
Jun 22 22:28:06 :: Russel (prayer): Ahh. Father Justice, your fortress is most welcoming, and this temple is nothing but magnificent. The altar before me brings a warmth I long desire. A warmth that I love and adore. It's the warmth of honour.
Jun 22 22:28:20 :: Russel (prayer): I have tried, during my whole life of service, to ask very little of you. It is your representation alone which makes my service worth while.
Jun 22 22:28:48 :: Russel (prayer): I recognize already that it is you that gives me courage, strength, and honour. It is you who gives me the will to obey those in the Knighthood, and it is you that provides me with what I need to protect the citizens of Solamnia.
Jun 22 22:29:25 :: Russel (prayer): It is your gift of light, your gift of righteousness, which gives me a kind heart to have pity on those who need it. It is your protective eye which wards me from darkness, and for that I will be greatful forever.
Jun 22 22:29:50 :: Russel (prayer): I apologize dearly if you dislike me asking for something, lord Justice. You gave me a second birth of life, free to live again after the hands of the Embodiment disgraced me.
Jun 22 22:30:18 :: Russel (prayer): The servants of the Embodiment disgraced themselves, and the ideals of honour all at the same time. They spread darkness where it did not belong. Darkness shouldn't belong; it should be nothing.
Jun 22 22:30:45 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice I ask of you this... Bless upon me an inner strength, an inner will, a gift of your abilities in courage, and bravery. Honour and obediance.
Jun 22 22:31:00 :: Russel (prayer): Let me walk closer to you than I ever have before, so that I may bring Justice at full force.
Jun 22 22:31:17 :: Russel (prayer): Justice, Lord Kiri-Jolith, has a belonging. Darkness, does not.
Jun 22 23:37:31 :: Russel (prayer): ...Lord Justice... Would it bother you that I ask of you something? I strive to ask very little of you, but I know that you give me a lot anyway.
Jun 22 23:38:16 :: Russel (prayer): You have given me life, more than once. You have given me honour, courage, and wisdom. Strength has been blessed upon me to move onward even in my most dire of moments, because you have watched over me.
Jun 22 23:38:23 :: Chemosh (prayer): Lord Justice...please...I want to have animal sex with Jenica.
Jun 22 23:38:43 :: Russel (prayer): It is in respect to that, father Justice, that I say thank you. There is no other deity I'd rather devote my life to. Your willpower to abolish darkness and destroy evil is great and unmatched. You are everything I wish to be, everything I try to be.
Jun 22 23:39:10 :: Russel (prayer): My sword is yours to guide, my heart is yours to persuade ultimately. Your honour is mine to follow, your example is mine to try and be. I will never succeed, though I can always try at my best, and never grow lazy in my effort.
Jun 22 23:39:13 :: Rafe (prayer): with an artifical tongue
Jun 22 23:39:31 :: Russel (prayer): Though, there is still something I must ask... Something I feel is needed in my life, something that I feel would help me bring Justice to where tyrants prevail.
Jun 22 23:39:46 :: Rafe (prayer): lol i dunno, that was his idea when he was recreated dunno if he's still going with that
Jun 22 23:40:18 :: Russel (prayer): I would like to walk with you, Kiri-Jolith, side by side. As men at arms, prepared to stand until every last evil tyrant is beaten on the battlefield. I would like to stand in unition with you.
Jun 22 23:40:39 :: Rafe (prayer): that's bordering homosexuality there fella
Jun 22 23:40:49 :: Russel (prayer): I would like to share righteous glory, father Justice. I would like to share blissful light with those that are deserving; with those that have kind hearts, and do not wish to cause chaos, or destruction.
Jun 22 23:41:00 :: Rafe (prayer): the great bison's gonna spear you up the arse
Jun 22 23:42:00 :: Russel (prayer): It is in these moments of glory, where holiness will be felt. Warmth will be shared, and comfort will be had. If it means that death must be had on my mortal life, then so be it. A righteous land of Krynn is far more great than a simple life like my own.
Jun 22 23:46:06 :: Russel (prayer): Even if it is not possible, greatest Kiri-Jolith, to fight side-by-side, at arms, then I hold no grudge. I will serve, day and night, sun set and sun rise. I will fight, moment after moment, breath after breath, until I have no breath left.
Jun 22 23:46:25 :: Russel (prayer): And I will do it, knowing that I've tried at my best to serve you, and that is all the motive I need.
Jun 23 00:01:57 :: Nuitari (prayer): Self, please make Telamon remain the fool he is, I promise I'll let you keep the remains
Jun 23 02:51:17 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Thank you for watching over me in my time of need. Thank you for guiding me when I couldn't see. I wish to serve you further. My life I pledge to you and the Triumvirate. Please watch over Myself and Knight battleman. Amem.
Jun 23 02:54:52 :: Russel (prayer): Thank you, Father Justice, for watching over Knight Verramos and I... It's with your eye, that we feel comfort, and security.
Jun 23 04:04:41 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Please watch over Knight Battleman and I as we travel outside Solamnia. Please guide our swords if we encounter any evil foes. Please light our path if we step into a dark area. May you bless our souls as we cast light upon those who are in the dark. Amem.
Jun 23 05:36:17 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Now I will rest my body. I want to thank you for keeping Knight Battleman and I safe from any danger we might have encountered. I just pray that I can walk beside you and honor you by passing the knowledge and blessings you grant me upon those who have darkness within there hearts. Amem. 
Jun 23 16:10:14 :: Maegor (prayer): Magisty, this faithfull servant thanks you for all the things you have bestowed upon him, he gives thanks to you for letting him serve your cause.
Jun 23 16:12:54 :: Maegor (prayer): Magisty, this servant of your asks you to bestow upon him your most holy touch, give him the strength to serve you, the power to protect thoes who are faithfull to you, the ability to bring forth your glory upon this realm
Jun 23 17:46:00 :: Russel (prayer): Kiri-Jolith, father of Justice... How fairs your day? I stand today, as I stand all days, in service to you. I stand in service to Solamnia, in service to you, as a Novice of the Sword.
Jun 23 17:46:25 :: Russel (prayer): I stand as a devoted swordsman, as a warrior, in service to you. My life is nothing but devotion, nothing but service. But it is all contradicted, because I do not feel as though I am in 'service'.
Jun 23 17:46:49 :: Russel (prayer): I do not feel as though it is in service, because I find reward in itself. I do it because I adore seeing righteousness prevail. I do it because I hate seeing evil tyrants cause chaos and destruction.
Jun 23 17:47:01 :: Russel (prayer): I do it because I feel as though I am making Krynn become a better place to be,  somehow... Some day, I would like to make the greater influence. I would like to abolish darkness and bring forth an utter purity of light.
Jun 23 17:47:20 :: Russel (prayer): I do it because I hope that I may honour you, Kiri-Jolith.
Jun 23 17:47:43 :: Russel (prayer): I had tried once before, striding alone on the battlefield, and I had failed... The hands of the Embodiment disgraced me with their dishonourable deeds, yet you spared me an additional life. A life where I could serve once again, and for that I am greatful.
Jun 23 17:48:28 :: Russel (prayer): It's in this life where I do not want to stop battling evil. I do not want to stop defeating evil. I strive for honourable glory, won by righteous warfare. But there would be something missing... And I've always felt this way.
Jun 23 17:48:55 :: Russel (prayer): I just haven't known what it is, but now, I understand. Kiri-Jolith, I would like to walk along side you on the battlefield. I would like to be a man at arms, standing side by side, a mighty, courageous force against the forces of tyranny and evil.
Jun 23 17:49:19 :: Russel (prayer): I would like to be the one that stands on the battlefield with you, glorious. The winners of an honourable battle, the reward being that evil is abolished. This is what I would wish to achieve, and what I would love to see happen...
Jun 23 17:50:36 :: Russel (prayer): You are everything I stand to achieve, father Justice.
Jun 23 18:14:42 :: Frantiska (prayer): Blessed be the Lady of Sea and Squall.  Blessed be Her power and grace in Storm and fury, Her seas that harbor countless bounty and beauty.  Long has it been since I was granted my life again by Her hands, and so it has been that I have set my life to Her's, seeking to do Her will and further Her goals.  Grateful am I for the lightning that kisses the sky, welcoming me home.
Jun 23 19:07:08 :: Frantiska (prayer): Blessed be your touch as it lights the sky, my Lady, my Queen.  Comforting is it to me to see the forks of lightning dance within the sky when my feet find me so far from your beautious seas.
Jun 23 21:56:22 :: Russel (prayer): Good eve, blessed Kiri-Jolith. I take these moments at your chapel to offer my thanks, for everything that you are, and prove yourself to be. You are what every warrior would dream to be like; honourable, brave, courageous. Your ideals are equally paralleled with strength, and a loving heart for the Light.
Jun 23 21:56:41 :: Russel (prayer): Your determination is something every knight and bringer of Justice should behold, and attain. You stop at no end to right the wrongs of evil, and you protect the innocents from any kind of injustice or darkness.
Jun 23 21:57:18 :: Russel (prayer): It's this example which I try to follow. I wish to become part of what you represent, to become a member of those ideals, and bring honour not only to itself, but to you and the other beings of light, be them mortal or deity.
Jun 23 21:57:34 :: Russel (prayer): Some day, if I am worthy, father Justice, if I am worthy of representing your ideals, representing the ideals of honourable warfare, glory, justice... I would like to walk along side you.
Jun 23 21:58:08 :: Russel (prayer): I would like to be a blessed child, so that I may stride steps along side of you. So that I may fight honourably as your man at arms. As a brother, like one would fight in the Knighthood with others in the ranks.
Jun 23 21:58:39 :: Russel (prayer): I would like to be a blessed child, so that I may stand with you on the battlefield, glorious. It is not glory unless every evil tyrant has been dealt with, until every blasphemy of evil has fallen. It is not glory unless righteousness shines down and dissipates any and all forms of darkness.
Jun 23 21:59:12 :: Russel (prayer): It's this glory that Solamnia deserves to become a part of... It's this glory that every other kind hearted being on the lands of Krynn deserve to be warmthened by.
Jun 23 22:00:11 :: Russel (prayer): Innocents do not deserve injustice. They do not deserve darkness, or foul punishment felt deemable by the hands of evil. If you would help me, we could change this. We could change the darkness that spreads ever slowly, and keep it at bay, so that we, as people, can rejoice.
Jun 23 22:01:05 :: Immanuel (prayer): Father of Good, Grant your Servant blessings.  Humble me in Your Light, and Guide me along my path.  Show me the way to your service, of Paladinship.
Jun 23 22:40:49 :: Alira (prayer): My Dark Majesty, refuse aid to the man Hitori for his refusal to seek the aid I provided. Aid so rarely given. He refused a dark pact and as a curse to the deal, curse his aid to only lie in my hands. Curse him so that any other assistance only deals him further harm.
Jun 23 23:56:20 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Your temple within the city of Kalaman is beautiful. I am in there when I am not patrolling the city of Kalaman. I am very pleased that I have come this far in the knighthood with you guiding me and my soul. I wish to walk beside you and carry out your will. I have done all in my power to serve you and the Triumvirate. I am honored to be placed within the knighthood. 
Jun 24 00:27:00 :: Russel (prayer): Bless you, Father Justice, for giving me the strength to travel great distances... Your gifts have given me the ability to assist a fellow Knight in equipping himself necessarily to protect Solamnia, and serve the Triumvirate.
Jun 24 00:51:35 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Please guard Knight Kistan, Knight Battleman and myself as we travel to Karthay. Please guide our sword if the people of Karthay attack us. I will attempt to bring those from the shadow into the light. I will spread you knowledge and guidance to those who have none. Bless us this day. 
Jun 24 01:11:23 :: Russel (prayer): Lord Justice, we're approaching a hidden tomb, swarmed with the gisgusting vileness of the Embodiment. This place is dark, very dark... If it wasn't for the light you shine before me, I would not know where to lead.
Jun 24 01:11:45 :: Russel (prayer): Might you bless us with your insight, we may be able to bring light to where it seems to have been forgotten.
Jun 24 01:27:40 :: Russel (prayer): Great Sword of Justice... Life demands that we rest for a few moments before we continue onward, lest we face death. I promise you, when we are atleast in moderate health, we will continue to abolish darkness and allow for righteous light to shine through.
Jun 24 01:29:50 :: Russel (prayer): Your strength is felt and it will be used valiantly. Light will shine. Powerfully.
Jun 24 01:31:27 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Knight Battleman and I are spread light to those who are in the shadow. They seem to be listening to us. Some feel as thou it is better to attack us. Please continue to watch over us. Our goals are simple to get as many people to see the light as possible. Please continue to guide our blades in combat. 
Jun 24 02:21:52 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, please watch over Knight Verramos here in Karthay, as the forces of evil are spoken without worry or regard... But rather, comfort, if that can be believed. This place is corroded with blasphemy, though I stand strong.
Jun 24 03:22:15 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, As I kneel before your altar I understand that you and the knighthood is all I have. Please grant me the strength I need to combat evil. Grant me the wisdow I need to spread light to those in the dark. Allow me to pass your blessings to those in need. 
Jun 24 12:11:14 :: Savaron (prayer): I offer  Habbakuk a prayer of Thanks o and of hin humblness
Jun 24 12:14:36 :: Savaron (prayer): I offer myself to you King Fisher to do your will
Jun 24 15:15:40 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, As I kneel bfore this altar, I feel at home. I want to serve you till my last days on krynn. I wish to spread light upon those you have none, Because I feel that is what you would like. I wish to bring to guilty before the innocent. I shall fight evil with the Strength and courage you have granted me upon being knighted. Thank you. 
Jun 24 15:23:52 :: Kendrall (prayer): (in Qualinesti)  E'li, I pray hear me this day.  I pray, Father, keep your hands upon the Knights - bless them and keep them safe.  Grant them wisdom, Father, and light their path as they defend Solamnia.  I pray for those whom you have blessed me with, good friends - I pray you bless them as well.  Grant your servant wisdom and knowledge, for whom else is above you, Father?  You are wisdom and knowledge itself; you are the Light that leads us all towards the path of holiness and righteousness.  I 
Jun 24 15:38:01 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, good morning. I see the light of righteousness shines freely upon these lands of Solamnia. It wouldn't be possible with you, or the other deities of Light, primarily those within the Triumvirate.
Jun 24 15:38:21 :: Russel (prayer): Righteousness is a thing to behold, great Sword of Justice. It brings onto us a sense of welcoming; warmth. Instead of cold, instead of darkness and blinding, we are adopted with kindness. We are able to see where are, and accept it, because it is holy.
Jun 24 15:38:43 :: Russel (prayer): It is this holiness which somehow seems restricted. Condemned from the rest of Krynn, and it does not need to be this way. Kiri-Jolith, we, as warriors, as fighters should step forth, and shine light to where it is belonging. Shine light where darkness corrodes the lands of innocent people.
Jun 24 15:39:04 :: Russel (prayer): We, as honourable and brave men, should stand on the battlefield until every tyrant has been defeated. Until every source of evil has parished into abolishment. This is when righteousness will be shared. This is when welcoming warmth will become part of the world, part of the entirety of Krynn.
Jun 24 15:39:25 :: Russel (prayer): I feel as though I am only able to do so much as a mortal fighter, as a mortal knight. No, I do not seek being a god, I simply wish that perhaps one day I can be with you as I fight, as I defeat tyrants honourably. It is with shared strength...
Jun 24 15:39:46 :: Russel (prayer): With unity, that we will find glory on the battlefield. Honourable, fair glory. We do not need to cheat our expeditions, nor do we need to cower in the shadows. Courage and bravery will shine through, our strength will hold durable, and we will succeed, I promise you.
Jun 24 15:40:20 :: Russel (prayer): As a united warrior with you, Kiri-Jolith, Light will shine through all forms of darkness, and tyrants will be abolished. Innocents will be saved, and the grevious wrongs of Evil will be set right once again. Warmth will felt.
Jun 24 15:40:51 :: Russel (prayer): If I stand worthy of your unmatched leadership on the battlefield, I can assure you that failure is not something I will accept. Death is the only way for me to truely fail; but even then I will strive to find a way to serve.
Jun 24 15:41:52 :: Russel (prayer): Each and every day I spend my time serving you, as a devoted warrior, and as a Knight. Each and every day I prepare myself for what may lay ahead, in the hands of evil.
Jun 24 15:42:54 :: Russel (prayer): I am but a trainee with an aspiring goal. It may be a task I will never achieve, but each day it is my effort that will put me a step closer. Whether I achieve it or not, I can still do my duties as a Knight.
Jun 24 15:43:40 :: Russel (prayer): I can still abolish darkness, and I can still right the wrongs of evil. It is with your aid, however, that the measure of success will extend much further. This I know, as you are the most formidable of all holy warriors.
Jun 24 15:45:24 :: Russel (prayer): In closing for my morning prayer, Father Justice, I would like to thank you for everything you've already blessed upon me. Life, twice. Courage and bravery, the will to go on. The strength to find ability in my left hand.
Jun 24 15:45:59 :: Russel (prayer): Without your gifts, I would be nothing right now. I'd be but a corpse laid into the ground... but I doubt I would be resting at peace. I would not rest because I would know from first hand that the Embodiment still has evils at strength.
Jun 24 15:46:57 :: Russel (prayer): Along side that of the other sides of Evil, there would be innocents facing injustice. Men and women becoming disgraced and dishonoured, there would be my fellow knights left with one less hand on the battlefield.
Jun 24 15:48:03 :: Russel (prayer): This is why I would not be able to rest, and perhaps this is why you've gifted me a second life. My fervor in service has only grown greater, lord Justice, and it will continue to each and every day.
Jun 24 15:48:30 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, As I kneels before the altar in Vingaard Keep I can't believe how breathe taking it is here. I know that I will shine light upon those in the dark. I wish to combat evil until my time has come to stand beside you. I wish to grant you all the you ask of me. Please grant me to the Strength I need to combat the evil that corrupts these lands.
Jun 24 15:48:35 :: Russel (prayer): May your strength and honourable ways reflect on the lives of every man, woman, and child.
Jun 24 17:38:49 :: Russel (prayer): Great Fist of Justice, may your spirit guide my soul and blade, so that I may have the heart to keep these tyrant ogres at bay. It is with our strength, that innocents will not be harmed, and Kalaman will remain safe.
Jun 24 17:59:59 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, please watch over both my health, and Adept Kendrall's. I fear we may become sick in the depths of the Black Wind's temple, but someone must shine light where righteousness has faded.
Jun 24 18:00:28 :: Russel (prayer): Help us keep Solamnia utterly holy. Let us keep these lands filled with glorious Light, and save them the dishonour of evil.
Jun 24 19:22:29 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, might I borrow your righteous fury for a moment? I come here to your chapel bearing a weapon of evil, a weapon of injustice and chaos. A weapon of destruction.
Jun 24 19:22:56 :: Russel (prayer): Might you lend your strength, this weapon called 'the Deathkiss' may be destroyed, and the evil that it contains as well. This is one of the many steps we must take to abolish all of the darkness which ravages our lands, and good will be of its own reward.
Jun 24 19:24:39 :: Russel (prayer): May righteousness shine freely from this day forward, stronger and stronger with each advancement that we take against the blasphemy of Evil.
Jun 24 19:25:13 :: Russel (prayer): I am an able warrior, a knight at that, and I can abolish evil and bring forth some Light to where it belongs. The temple of the Black Wind felt the wrath of justice, and what was wrong was made right once again.
Jun 24 19:25:38 :: Russel (prayer): With me was a cleric of the father to the Triumvirate, but I feel as though I will not always be that lucky.
Jun 24 19:26:04 :: Russel (prayer): It would be of my greatest honour to walk with you one day, Kiri-Jolith, perhaps all days, as a Paladin in your faith, so that I may be increasingly courageous. More brave, so that I may carry part of the strength and leadership you quite clearly possess.
Jun 24 19:26:34 :: Russel (prayer): It is with your unmatched wisdom and guidance that my sword may strike critically upon the heart of Evil, and we may stand glorious on the open battlefield, with no more tyrants to best. We will have won with honour.
Jun 24 19:27:13 :: Russel (prayer): It is with our unition, great father, that Justice in itself will shine brightly from afar, reaching outwards to all lands, even those extending outside of Solamnia. It is with our efforts, that evil and blasphemy will be destroyed.
Jun 24 22:37:23 :: Anoreth (prayer): Bah'Mut, the symbol of the Poisoned Breath grows large in the sky this eve, of this I am sure a dark omen spreads.  I beseech thee, Oh Great Father, lend your Compassion to the good and faithful people of Krynn, see to them in what is to be a trying time.  Use me, my Lord, as your vessel as you will, I am, as always, your servant, especially in what may be dark times ahead.
Jun 24 22:44:23 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, I have spread the light upon those who couldn't see. I have granted shelter to those who have no home. My duties as a Knight of Solamnia and a faithful follower are being fulfilled daily. Please grant me the courage and strength to fight the evil that corrupts these holy lands in the shadows. Please help me find peace while I am still hurting from the death of my wife. Allow me to be close within your ranks and I will do all in my power to shine light in all the dark places of Krynn.
Jun 25 00:07:22 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, may your heart and soul guide my blade as I cleanse this world free of rotten, foul beasts. May our strength bring forth shining Light, and create for everlasting, righteous lfie.
Jun 25 15:50:51 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Thank you for protecting me while I sleep. I shall grant light to those in the dark. I will carry out your will with my life. I shall turn dark into light at all cost. I shall shelter the innocent, And bring the guilty to justice. Those who follow the embodiment I shall turn to the light. Your will shall be carried out. 
Jun 25 16:27:54 :: Kendrall (prayer): Father, I thank thee for such good friends such as Jocelyn Auraven.  I pray, Father, keep her safe and let thine hand be upon her, and impart unto her the knowledge and wisdom she needs.  In thine holy name.
Jun 25 20:13:48 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Please grant me Strength, And guard me from the evil that dwells here. I shall try to convert the evil here. Show them the light. Some just choose to attack me. Please guide my blade during battle and guard my soul from infection. 
Jun 25 20:21:27 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, I feel the pain of the people within this temple. I have granted some people freedom from the black wind. Please grant me the power to end the suffer of all within this temple. I will not fail you. I shall grant freedom to all. 
Jun 25 20:42:36 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, I have done as I have said I would. I converted some of the Black Winds followers. They have seen the light. Other I regret to say didn't. I am sorry if I failed you. I just ask that you destory the items I have place upon the altar. Thank you for granting me the wisdom to give people hope. Thank you for granting me Strength to combat the evil that dwelled within that temple. Most of all thank you for keeping my soul safe. 
Jun 25 20:42:59 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, may your Sword guard the blessed child of Branchala as we strive to destroy the tyrants which inhabit this lost tomb, and instead shine righteous Light, to where it was not only forgotten, but to where it is deserving.
Jun 25 20:59:01 :: Karioh (prayer): I'm sorry Songmaster! The meanies...hurt me...
Jun 25 20:59:39 :: Russel (prayer): Father, Justice... We, the child of Branchala. Please, he is hurt horribly. Do not let him go. The hands of Evil have bested us, we cannot continue onward in our state.
Jun 25 21:04:35 :: Russel (prayer): Bless you, Lord Justice, for healing us. You've given us the strength to continue in service of the Light.
Jun 25 21:30:52 :: Russel (prayer): Sweet father of Justice, father of Righteousness and honour, thank you for giving me strength to cleanse a lost tomb free of the Embodiment's evils that inhabited it so grantedly. With your assistance, we brought forth light and Justice to where it was lost, to where it was forgotten.
Jun 25 21:31:36 :: Russel (prayer): With me I have brought a donation of coins, so that I may service the temple and its patrons. So that those seeking alms may receive it, and so that your blessed children may have adequate meals.
Jun 25 21:32:03 :: Russel (prayer): I provide it so that the forces of Light may be strengthened, and so we can hold strong against the forces of Blasphemy. Against Evil.
Jun 25 21:32:48 :: Russel (prayer): It is but thirty platinum coins, though I plan on getting and providing more in the near future, good Father. The interests of the Light serve as the interests of my own as well. I will not allow ourselves to be unprepared for what the Evils may have gathered for us.
Jun 25 21:33:23 :: Russel (prayer): In acknowledgement and thanks for your assistance earlier this day, I offer you a rewarding meal. Though it must not meet the luxury you no doubt get from your own cooking, I hope it can serve as something to fill your hunger after the day's work.
Jun 25 21:33:50 :: Russel (prayer): We stood together today, Lord Justice, and we opened the window for the Light to shine freely. Evil was abolished, and Krynn became a better place. A small adjustment for now, but many of these, for nearly all of our days will bring a large impact on the world. This is a promise of mine to you.
Jun 25 21:34:19 :: Russel (prayer): Warmth will spread. Cold, chilling winds will grow deaf and unfelt. Darkness will evaporate into nothingness as we bring Justice to where tyrants have done wrong.
Jun 25 21:34:57 :: Russel (prayer): Once again, bless you for everything. You've cleansed my wounds in a time of need so that I could continue returning the favour by cleansing the world of its occupying Evil.
Jun 25 21:35:20 :: Russel (prayer): You have given me strength, honour, and courage. With this, I am proud to be able to serve you. I am proud to be able to bring Righteousness upon the lands of Krynn. I am proud to be a Knight of Solamnia. My greatest of thanks, Kiri-Jolith.
Jun 25 23:49:55 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, might you offer lady Lucien and I our blessings for when we are within the Embodiment's tomb? We will be fighting the beasts of evil, so that we can bring Light and righteousness back into strength.
Jun 25 23:50:31 :: Russel (prayer): As a token of my gratitude for your ever watchful eye, Lord Justice, I offer a donation of coins.
Jun 25 23:51:10 :: Jenica (prayer): Kiri-Jolith.. I am to set out on my first real mission to seek evil and destroy it where I may find it. Sir Battleman is allowing me to accompany him to a den of evil far to the east, near Istar and my home.
Jun 25 23:51:25 :: Russel (prayer): It is with our honour, courage, and bravery, that we will find Light where darkness has thought to be victorious. They can no longer hide, for we will step into their shadows, and destroy it from the inside out.
Jun 25 23:52:08 :: Russel (prayer): Evil will be abolished, tyrants will be defeated. The result in its own is reward enough, but the warmth and welcoming to the newly found Light is certainly an endorsed comfort.
Jun 25 23:53:21 :: Russel (prayer): May you guide our hearts and souls as we battle in each moment, and may your very own serve as a protectful ward against the evils which we face. Bless you, Lord Kiri-Jolith, for all that you have given us already.
Jun 25 23:53:45 :: Jenica (prayer): I do this for the sake of good, and for the sake of my home. I ask only that you look well upon these actions if they are worthy of your approval, and to grant Russel your blessings. He truly wishes to do your will, and would die doing so.
Jun 25 23:55:05 :: Jenica (prayer): I will continue to seek worthiness in your eyes, and work what good I may in this world. Thank you for hearing my prayers, great Bison.
Jun 26 00:26:35 :: Russel (prayer): May your sword watch over your devoted child, Lord Justice, and may I be able to keep her in good health during our expedition for righteousness.
Jun 26 00:35:42 :: Jenica (prayer): Kiri-Jolith watch over us, while we destroy the foulness which has infested this tomb. I was not prepared for what we would encounter, but I have steeled my resolve. Your will shall be done.
Jun 26 21:20:34 :: Russel (prayer): Lord Justice, might you lend us your righteous fury, we may bring light to the darkness this place clearly holds! It is with our strength, good father, that tyrants will be destroyed.
Jun 27 00:07:32 :: Russel (prayer): There is nothing like the sweet smell of righteousness, would you not agree, Lord Justice? When there is life in the air, when warmth is felt, and when the Light may shine beautifully upon all, there is a time to rejoice.
Jun 27 00:08:01 :: Russel (prayer): There is the gift of relax, the gift of beauty and holiness. But such a gift cannot be rewarded without some kind of labour. No, such a gift can't be given without work.
Jun 27 00:08:34 :: Russel (prayer): Such a gift can't be shared with all that are around us, great Father of Justice, not until we as warriors, defenders of the Light step forth and abolish the Darkness which ravages the land each and every day.
Jun 27 00:08:55 :: Russel (prayer): If we, as the Righters of Wrong, do not step forth and commit to our goals, to our oath, then the Light cannot rejoice. The sweet smell of righteousness can not flow graciously over Krynn.
Jun 27 00:09:28 :: Russel (prayer): It is a time for work, then for reward. Then for relax. Please Father Justice, assist me so that the world of Krynn may feel the reward we are quite able to receive.
Jun 27 00:09:40 :: Russel (prayer): Our combined strength and unition will create a strong, utterly brave and courageous force. We will be heroic, in faith of the Light, and bring it to all of Krynn, where it is definitely belonging.
Jun 27 00:10:07 :: Russel (prayer): It is after our work that all beings, mortal and otherwise, may rejoice in the Light. They may enjoy the sweet smell of Righteousness while feeling the warmth of Life.
Jun 27 00:10:53 :: Russel (prayer): It is because of this reward I speak of, that I wish to give to the children of the Light, to those free of evil intent, that I serve you, Kiri-Jolith. I see the uselessness of Evil, I see their pathetic intent and wish to over-rule it...
Jun 27 00:11:13 :: Russel (prayer): I wish to smite it with a blaze of holy fury, the likes of which will get rid of it forever. And I have been trying. I've been battling countless beasts within a Tomb, inhabited by those of the Embodiment.
Jun 27 00:12:25 :: Russel (prayer): I have found the Black Wind's hidden temples and I have cleansed it free of the plague bringing demons. It has all been done honourably, Lord Justice, and above all else, I believe if you were not who you are, then I could not have done it. Faith was my strength.
Jun 27 00:12:57 :: Russel (prayer): They have felt the wrath of Justice, right in their very own home. Their shadows have been destroyed from the inside out, and Light was brought to where it was meant to shine.
Jun 27 00:13:15 :: Russel (prayer): I have opened windows, lord Justice, I have spread the curtains. It is time for Light to spread freely.
Jun 27 00:15:16 :: Maegor (prayer): Magisty, I give thanks to all that you have bestowed upon me, for letting me serve your rightfull cause, and to be a servant of yours. Magisty, your faithfull servant asks you to bestow upon him the strength to serve you to his fullest ability, the power to protect your loyal servants, and the ability to do that which he wishes above all else, to bring forth your honorable cause to this world. He asks you to bestow upon him your godly touche so he may withstand all who try to cause harm to your cau
Jun 27 00:16:18 :: Maegor (prayer): Magisty, i am yours to do as you wish. I live only to serve and to bring forth your will. I bow down to your might and wisdome.
Jun 27 00:19:50 :: Maegor (prayer): Magisty, hear my prayer. I wish nothing but to serve you to the best of my abilities, to serve you even more than i am capable of doing.
Jun 27 00:49:22 :: Immanuel (prayer): Father of Good, Grant your servant wisdom and virtue, so that he might be a better servant unto you, and help to clense the world of Evil, and it's foul servants.
Jun 27 21:01:29 :: Savaron (prayer): I offer a prayer to Hibbakuk offering my humble hand to his service
Jun 27 22:17:10 :: Russel (prayer): With the windows that are now open, Father Justice, light will shine. May your Sword guide over me as I keep the chaotic beasts, known as Ogres at bay. They have saught death and destruction on Kalaman before...
Jun 27 22:17:23 :: Russel (prayer): I must make sure it does not happen again. Thank you in advance for all strength that I have, while battling the untamed brutes. They will not bear the strength to do what they did again.
Jun 27 22:17:44 :: Russel (prayer): They will not make what is right wrong again. No beast will, as long as I have my sword and my wit involved with the fray.
Jun 27 23:58:36 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, assist me in abolishing this blasphemy! Do not allow these innocents to be bested at the hands of Evil!
Jun 28 00:24:59 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, might you bless these fallen villagers, with a righteous guardianship, that will keep their souls free from the tyrant deities that may seek them more wrong than they already have gotten...
Jun 28 00:32:23 :: Maegor (prayer): Magisty, aid your faithfull servant to do what is required of him, give him the strength to do what you wish, the power to protect thoes faithfull to you, the ability to do what he wishes more than anything... to serve you to his last breath.
Jun 28 00:34:26 :: Maegor (prayer): I am a hollow shell with your essence, bestow upon this servant of yours your godly touch, instruct your vessel to do your bidding.
Jun 28 01:27:38 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Today the Solamnic lands suffered a big loss. Knight Battleman and I were sent to a village to dispatch a troll. We got there a few seconds to late. I am sorry if I failed you in this time. I pray that you watch over the souls within the heavens, And keep the little girl safe from any harm. I shall search for her to bring her to safety. Please allow me to find her and raise her as my own. 
Jun 28 01:29:51 :: Russel (prayer): Great Justice, I was called upon by Lord Lucius and his council yesterday... I was asked questions, and I spoke from my heart. I wish upon it that I spoke what rung as music to their ears.
Jun 28 01:30:05 :: Russel (prayer): I was excused, and left until today. I was called upon to Solanthus, to visit Lord Anselm. On our way, we found a village terrorized by a single troll. All but two were killed.
Jun 28 01:30:49 :: Russel (prayer): All but two were wronged by Evil. Wronged by Injustice. The foul beast, brought EVIL, into Solamnia! The Land of the Triumvirate and we were too late! Innocents have fallen, father Justice, they have fallen to the chaotic ways of Evil!
Jun 28 01:31:10 :: Russel (prayer): Somehow I feel as though I have failed, for if I had left sooner, perhaps the villagers would be alive... However, the troll was slain, and Justice was brought to the village. Now, it is empty, but atleast they were given a burial, Lord Justice.
Jun 28 01:31:15 :: Cedrif (prayer): I shall keep trying to work towards becoming what you have for me. I wish to become your paladin. I shall serve you with undying devotion. I shall also fight the forces of evil just like Humna fought against the Dark Queen. I will pledge my life to the your will. I shall heal the souls of those who hurt. Thank you for listening Draco Paladin. I will not fail you.
Jun 28 01:31:25 :: Russel (prayer): I ask of you to bless each and every fallen man, woman, and child. Let them live blissfully in the afterlife, Father Justice, let them live in the Righteousness they so blatently had stolen away from them at the hands of Evil.
Jun 28 01:31:43 :: Russel (prayer): I am furious. Not a veangeful fury, not a brute's fury. I am filled with a holy fury, something I feel when I deal with Evil. It comes each and every time I deal with the cowering likeness of Darkness.
Jun 28 01:32:23 :: Russel (prayer): It is moments like these that I serve you, Kiri-Jolith. It is so I can save these lives, save them from Evil just ripping their very essence of life away from them. Save them from Darkness overpowering where they do not belong. Darkness does not belong, period.
Jun 28 01:32:44 :: Russel (prayer): Every person should live their due, and never have it mercilessly shortened, or taken away from some unrighteous force. This is what I believe, and this is what I abide by.
Jun 28 01:32:50 :: Russel (prayer): This is why I abolish darkness, this is why I serve you, and this is why I hate Evil.
Jun 28 01:33:17 :: Russel (prayer): May your sword guide my own, and I'll continue to pray that each and every day you assist me with the cause, as a man at arms with me on the battlefield. I know that we both hate for things like this to happen.
Jun 28 01:35:12 :: Russel (prayer): ...May we bring ultimate Righteousness on the passionate creation of Krynn, filled with Light and Holiness, maintained by Justice, and protected by Guardianship.
Jun 28 12:26:03 :: Kendrall (prayer): Father, I pray hear me this day.  I pray you would bless your Knights, yea bless them and keep them safe from harm's path.  I pray for the friends you've blessed me with, I pray keep them safe and lead them in your ways.  I pray, Father, show me your glory, your majesty, and your righteousness, that I would walk therein and become one of your most faithful servants.  Let all be done in thy holy name.
Jun 28 14:09:17 :: Kendrall (prayer): Father, I thank thee for choosing me to be a priest in your holy church.  I pray, Father, continue to guide me in your ways, that I would shew this people your glory and majesty.  Let all be done in thy holy name. 
Jun 28 17:45:21 :: Nahane (prayer): who's up therE?
Jun 28 18:22:39 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, I will pray that you're with me when I fight this obvious follower of the Blasphemy. They will face Justice first hand, and what Darkness they bring will be abolished, blatently by the Righteous force of Light.
Jun 28 18:25:14 :: Maegor (prayer): Magisty, if it is your wish to take your servant then i come to you willingly. Give him the strength to do your bidding. This is my last act for you my beloved Queen, at last i may bathe in your glory.
Jun 28 18:31:16 :: Russel (prayer): Lord Justice, may the abolished man of Darkness receive some hospitality in the afterlife, for he has shown honour in the faith of his Goddess.
Jun 28 20:48:10 :: Russel (prayer): Great Kiri-Jolith, you were with me when I brought Justice to where it was due. I abolished a son of the Darkness, a son of the Embodiment, and with that light most definitely began to shine.
Jun 28 20:48:53 :: Russel (prayer): I am proud to have honoured you, lord Justice, in bringing death to a tyrant of evil. Honourably, at that, for we did agreed on measures revolving around fair play.
Jun 28 20:49:12 :: Russel (prayer): It was a battle of faith, and the Righteousness of the Light was proven stronger than the defiant ways of Evil. The chaos and destruction brought from the man will be never more.
Jun 28 20:50:12 :: Russel (prayer): While a tyrant of Blasphemy, the son of Evil was honourable in his measures, defending for what he believed in. Be it misguided, and definitely the wrong path, he stood for it courageously, and for that he deserves commendment.
Jun 28 20:50:29 :: Russel (prayer): Though, ultimately, a force of Evil has seen the Justice which was at hand, and in utter truth, it was deserved. No force of Evil should be treading freely, for Evil is atrocity.
Jun 28 20:51:02 :: Russel (prayer): Kiri-Jolith, may we walk as men at arms for every day in passing, and may we bring Light every day upon Krynn. That was my promise before, and that is what my promise is today, as it is all days.
Jun 28 20:51:21 :: Russel (prayer): With me I have brought a token of coins, a small sum of thirty five platinum. I offer it as a donation to those of your church, lord Justice. I pray that it will be spent well by our brothers and sisters in Justice.
Jun 28 20:51:49 :: Russel (prayer): I will leave it in your chapel, Lord Justice. I'll hope that someone does not fall upon it that should not.
Jun 28 22:25:17 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Please grant me the vision to see Rossdir true heart. I wish for him to live in peace with the rest of the world. I shall help him any way I can. I shall heal his soul's pain. Thank you Mi'Lord.
Jun 29 01:57:42 :: Karde (prayer): Bless my sword Holy Triumvirate. I come before you as an instrument of your will. Use me to rain death upon all who would oppose the Light. Use me as a messenger of warning to the forces of Darkness. Grant me the strength to smite your foes into dust in your holy Names. Use me to bring ruination upon Evil. I will be the flaming brand in your capable and omnipotent Hands. Thank you, Heavenly Fathers. 
Jun 29 09:47:57 :: Kendrall (prayer): Father, I pray hear me this day.  I thank thee, Father, for thy mercy and kindness, for knowledge and truth.  For whom else can it come from, Father, but you?  I pray keep thine hands upon the Knights of Solamnia; bless them and keep them.  I pray bless those whom I have the honor of calling my friends, and help me to lead them in thy ways.  Grant thy servant wisdom and guidance, for how else can I show this people your ways?  Let all be done in thy holy name.
Jun 29 12:36:01 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, As I kneel before your altar my heart feels as thou I should be within the temple grounds all the time. My heart is also one within the Knighthood. I have granted those who follow light undying devotion. I have protected those of the light with my life, And I have fought evil to only win. I have turned some of the evil I have encountered away from the dark and into the light. I shall Continue to do so as long as I am still able to walk. I will be your devoted follower until my days c
Jun 29 14:12:55 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Please grant me the vision to see what happened in this temple. I wish to see the people who cause this suffer upon your children and bring justice. These spirits aren't resting because of injustice. I shall bring justice for them.
Jun 29 14:23:26 :: Cedrif (prayer): Draco Paladin, Please grant the spirits within this temple the peace they need to rest at ease. I shall bring justice to those who have wronged the people within this temple. Please grant me the Knowledge and wisdom at which I seek.

My soul is forever yours.

Jun 29 21:14:41 :: Russel (prayer): I regularly seek Evil and bring Light to where it was lost, dear Mother of the Triumvirate. It is not without danger that I perform my acts of battle, in faith of Kiri-Jolith. While strong and at a magnificent bond with the Sword of Justice, I've fallen ill...
Jun 29 21:14:57 :: Russel (prayer): I have fallen Ill under the hands of the Embodiment. A curse inhabits my soul, leaving me with little ease for rest, or for the matter, relax. I would like to be alleviated of this curse, Skymistress, so that I may continue to fight diligently as a Warrior of the Light.
Jun 29 21:15:24 :: Russel (prayer): I do not like resting in alms while Evil stands free, while Evil brings pain and suffering to those around us. Skymistress, if you might save me from this affliction, save me from the Unrighteousness of Evil, I will be dearly greatful.
Jun 29 21:21:52 :: Russel (prayer): It is with your healing, dearest Skymistress, that I may be able to continue servicing the Light, in all days, as I should as a paladin of Kiri-Jolith. It is with your healing that I may continue to shine righteousness over Krynn.

Jun 29 21:23:49 :: Russel (prayer): Let me not feel sickly over a curse from the Embodiment.
Jun 29 21:27:02 :: Russel (prayer): Perhaps you are busy with those more needy than myself. Something I completely understand, Skymistress, and would not ask of you to leave them for my sake, for I am still able to hold my own with some strength.
Jun 29 21:46:01 :: Russel (prayer): Skymistress, you've found time in a truely busy schedule for taking ease upon those who ask of it, and for that I offer my thanks. I can readvance in my endeavours to bring Light to where Evil has brought darkness now. You have my greatest of gratitude.

Jun 30 00:57:26 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, I take this moment of prayer to offer my greatest of thanks for you being with me on the battlefield against the Blasphemy of Evil. It was with your aid that we were able to abolish so much darkness and bring forth righteousness, bring forth Light and warmth.
Jun 30 00:57:52 :: Russel (prayer): Through our battles of standing diligently and faithful, standing strong on the battlefield, I was bestowed with a curse. It is nothing to worry about, however, because the Blessed Mother, the Skymistress, tended to it lovingly, and for that I am greatful.
Jun 30 00:58:29 :: Russel (prayer): I would like to offer the Skymistress my thanks for allowing me to continue fighting Evil head-on. Without her aid I feel I would've still been stopped short with that curse, yet my urge to continue abolishing Evil would've stayed strong, as it always does. An unhappy match, I must say...
Jun 30 00:59:19 :: Russel (prayer): In mention of healing and becoming back to status, I am going to take this night to relax and prepare myself for the fight tomorrow, to bring even more Light to Krynn.

They seem to want war with everyone. Please grant your servant what I seek. Thank you Draco Paladin.

Jun 30 19:15:09 :: Anoreth (prayer): Great Father, Bah'Mut, this place....this temple, by your grace my Lord, what has befallen this place?  Stricken it is.  Poor honorifics of blessed grace, Lordly Justice, the Great Bison unarmed and cleaved asunder.  Mightly Lord of Sea and Beast, the Fisher King driven deep, the Blessed Lady, the Healing Hand stricken and defaced.  Wise and Truthful, the Lordly Mantis blinded, the Songs of the Bard made to seem silent, and the Son of White, gagged on filth, his Art shattered.  Such wanton destruct
Jun 30 19:17:32 :: Anoreth (prayer): Such wanton destruction and heathern blasphemy is this.  Short is my breath as I think on what dishonor is wrought upon your seat, my Loved Lord.

Jun 30 19:23:56 :: Anoreth (prayer): Great Father, the dishonor that has been wrought upon your likeness here is grievous to me.  My spirit weeps as my mind reels, such agony has been set upon the faithful here.  Many years too late have I come to be of aid of the living here, my Lord.  Long has this disgrace sat, but much will I do to atone as I may, Great Father.  Long have your faithful walk these halls in anguish and dispair, long has your Reverend Daughter set upon her vigil.
Jun 30 19:27:52 :: Anoreth (prayer): I ask of you, Draco Paladin, lend me your strength of will here to do what I must.  Steel my nerve against the terror of the tormented that haunt these halls.  Grant me the strength to grace these shadows of faith the Compassion of final rest, my Lord.  Long has been their suffering, horrid their fall at the deceptions of the Prince of Lies.  Let me shine the light of truth upon their souls again, freeing them to the oblivion in which they cherish your embrace.
Jun 30 20:04:54 :: Anoreth (prayer): I thank you, Great Father, for the strength that was required.  For the ability to see the pain and suffering in the ghostly visage of the lost faithful and to see not utter fear, but the need for Compassion.  The deed has been done, my most honored Lord, all of the lost that came unto me I have sent to their final sleep with your forgiveness and blessing, that they may be free of their pain and welcome in your embrace.

Jun 30 23:22:17 :: Russel (prayer): Father Justice, the flames of Destruction held no permenant impact on our city of Kalaman. With our strength, we saved lives, and put out the fire. We abolished the Chaos that some Evil force wished to bring upon us...
Jun 30 23:22:32 :: Russel (prayer): I will seek this force out, and have Justice brought to all of those involved.
Jun 30 23:26:35 :: Russel (prayer): Lord Kiri-Jolith, may your steps lead mine as I search for the Force of Evil which has assaulted Kalaman so... Injustice has been ravaged on our city, the likes of Right has been made Wrong, and we must fix it.
Jun 30 23:27:34 :: Russel (prayer): Luckily, no lives were taken, from what I am aware of. We battled the flames of Chaos and they were dealt with, and the source is soon to feel the same defeat. May we, as Holy Warriors of the Light, bring Justice, bring Righteousness.

Krevar I haven't heard from in sometime. I shall keep on killing outcast and I shall spread vengeance on those who wrong me. Like that elf who think he is the king of the world. Little does he know I will be the king.

Nov 17 19:15:37 :: Voralynn (prayer): Indeed, Master.  I see why you have little desire of these cattle, their faith is pitious.

Nov 17 21:55:30 :: Zaiandre (prayer): Oh almighty Queen Takhisis, I continue to serve and protect Your interests here upon Ansalon, with my whole being.

Nov 19 21:09:23 :: Alviard (prayer): I stand here, as I have since the day of fate's judgement, as a sentinel and guardian of the creatures of this world. From now on, until the end of days, I will forever be "The King Fisher's Oculus".
Nov 19 23:44:06 :: Kasch (prayer): There's not one day that goes by without me hearing the whining politics of the clerics...the paladins...the druids...the warriors. Beliefs being pressed and defended out of their own greediness of self preserverence. Hardly anyone takes the time to appricate the finer things in life. So while they fight their battles of good  verses evil, I'll be sure to tend to their pockets, I'm running a little low on gold.
Nov 21 20:03:02 :: Ghowoul (prayer): Horned One, It brings me pleasure to say that all is going as I have planned so far. I have been taken care of the outcast in which they all were slain and they blood now flows within the chalice in which I stand before.

Nov 22 12:09:29 :: Ghowoul (prayer): Horned One, I come before you on this day to grant Kit here your favor. For he wishes vengeance upon those who have wronged him.

I shall also keep on dealing with the outcast you have deemed unworthy to help with our destiny. 
Nov 22 12:24:12 :: Armantaro (prayer): I have a small favor to ask, Quen Illumini. Some time ago, a man I knew, Shiiard, died. As well as a man known as Chaldric.

Watch over them if you can, and see that they are honored, as all who are dutiful and fallen should be. Your humble servant requests it, my goddess.

The temple is going to be the most feared with Malharic and myself at the helm. I promise. 
Nov 24 00:11:20 :: Ghowoul (prayer): Horned one, Guard myself and Malharic as we clean out the weak that dwell upon Krynn. We shall fill the field with so many corpses that the fire we use to burn them will touch the heavens. No one who is weak will be safe.

Nov 28 17:31:49 :: Alviard (prayer): King Fisher, this woman...evil woman...tests the patience of those nearest. Fortify me as you have always done, that I might strike hard and true if it should come to such. Evil in the lands of light is not something I care to watch in a passive state.
