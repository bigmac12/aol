<h1> Ziv's Office </h1>
<pre>
   Scraps of paper litter the room while half finished mobs and objs lurk in
the shadows ready to jump out and grab the unwary builder who has a moment to
spare.  A large printing press dominates the middle of the room churning out
charts day and night.  The machine was obviously designed and built by a very
clever gnome.  His workmanship is evident due to the frequent revisions of all
the charts the machine makes to correct mistakes that "weren't there before".
A giant axe rest against the side of the machine awaiting the time when Zivilyn
must once again behead a builder for leaving a zone unfinished, not completing
their zone on time or just trying to disappear for no good reason.
