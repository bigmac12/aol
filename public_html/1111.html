<h1> Her Majesty's Lair </h1>
<pre>
   This massive alcove houses the lair of the Dark Queen.  The ceiling is not
visible, lost in the darkness which swirls overhead.  The vast darkness
radiates with an intense heat.  The walls are draped with irridescent black
silk which blows gently in the floor has been littered with Her horde as well
as several oversized, velvet pillows of deepest purple and green.  Standing off
the the side, within easy reach of the horde, is a large saucer of milk resting
upon a pedestal carved from onyx.  The soft, warm glow of hundreds of
flickering candles illuminates the lower portion of the alcove.
