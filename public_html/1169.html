<h1> A Fiery Hot Volcano </h1>
<pre>
   You stand upon a towering column deep inside a fiery hot volcano.  The air
is so hot and thick it almost chokes you.  Looking over the edge far below you
can see the molten lava flowing this way and that.  It is a wonder that the
flesh does not melt from your bone with the intensity of the heat around you.
A shimmering ball seems to encompass the column holding back the intense heat
and protecting you.
