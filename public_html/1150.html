<title> Reorx's Forge </title>
<h1> Reorx's Forge </h1>
<pre>
   You stand in the presense of the great forge of Reorx, with which he created
the stars and the Greystone of Gareth among other things.  The room is
intensely hot as great waves of heat radiant from a huge forge standing in one
corner of the room.  The walls are plastered with maps of all sorts of things,
from great pictures of various areas of Ansalon to wondrous drawings of various
beautiful looking weapons and bits of armour.  In the middle of the room sits
the great anvil itself.  At least four feet across and weighing more than five
tons, the anvil gleams black in the light cast from the forge.  Sitting next to
the anvil is an immense dwarven hammer with which Reorx pounds out his
incredible creations.
