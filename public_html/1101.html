<h1> A Gigantic, Twisted Bronze Tower </h1>
<pre>
   The featureless landscape of the Abyss is constantly changing.  The ground
and sky merge together, both an unnatural shade of pinkish-red.  An eerie
horizon line broken by a gigantic, twisted bronze tower seperates the two.  A
pair of glowing crimson eyes peer out from the highest window, sending chills
through your spine and moans and screams can be heard occasionally.  A strange
rasping voice whispers unintelligable words at you seemingly from all
directions, and the scent of decay floats through the air.
