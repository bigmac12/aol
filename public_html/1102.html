<h1> The Abyss </h1>
<pre>
   The featureless landscape of the Abyss is constantly changing.  It is
familiar yet horribly strange.  It is lifeless yet teeming with life.  The
ground and the sky merge together.  Both are an unnatural shade of pinkish-red.
Only an eerie horizon line separates the two.  Floating above is a strange,
undulating pattern of the face of Takhisis.  Off to the side is a large alcove,
enshrouded in a darkness that seems to come from within.
