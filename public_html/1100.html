<h1> The Broken Scale, 222nd Level of the Abyss. </h1>
<pre>
   Here in the bowels of the Abyss has been created a large platform formed of
bone.  Upon the platform is a throne woven from the dark souls of the Tanar'ri.
Its black surface shows no reflection of the pale green light shining from the
layers above.  Barely noticable in the gloom, things flit between the dark
shadow cast from things above.  Over the edge of the platform, nothing but the
endless chasm that is the Abyss looms.  Below an eerie purple light seeps up
like a blood from a fresh corpse.
